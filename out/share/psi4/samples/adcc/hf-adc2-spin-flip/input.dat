#! spin-flip ADC(2)/6-31G calculation of hydrogen-fluoride near the bond dissociation.
#! We tackle the singlet ground state and its singlet excited states by a triplet UHF
#! reference, flipping the spin during excitation. The first excited states of the ADC(2)
#! calculation now describes the actual ground state.
