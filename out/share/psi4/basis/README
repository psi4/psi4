Many of the basis sets in this directory are automatically generated
from files and scripts in the primitives/ directory, particularly the
Dunning correlation-consistent basis sets and some of the Pople basis
sets.  The primitives/ directory contains subsets of the basis sets that
can be combined in various ways (e.g., the diffuse functions and the
core-valence functions are often stored in separate files from the main
basis set, so that they can be combined in various different ways to produce
final basis set files that are then copied up to this directory).

If you are thinking of editing these files to update the Psi4 basis
set library, especially for Dunning or Pople basis sets, outline your
plans in a GitHub issue for advice on how to proceed
