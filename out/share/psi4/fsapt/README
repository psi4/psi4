This directory contains python and pymol scripts for use with the F-ISAPT code
in PSI4. Contents:

fsapt.py - script to postprocess F-SAPT and F-ISAPT data to produce order-2
    tables and order-1 PDB files.
    Usage: fsapt.py [fsapt-dirname]
fsaptdiff.py - script to perform F-SAPT/F-ISAPT analysis on two chemical
    systems with similar functional group topology (usually with substitutions)
    to produce a difference analysis. The F-SAPT analysis for the two chemical
    systems are also performed as if fsapt.py were run on each of these systems
    individually.
    Usage: fsaptdiff.py fsapt-A-dirname fsapt-B-dirname [fsapt-D-dirname]
copy_pymol.py - Copy pymol scripts for order-1 PDB file analysis to a working
    directory. Copies scripts out of the pymol directory
    Usage: copy_pymol.py [fsapt-dirname]
copy_pymol2.py - Copy pymol scripts for order-1 PDB file analysis to a working
    directory. Copies scripts out of the pymol2 directory
    Usage: copy_pymol2.py [plot-dirname]
