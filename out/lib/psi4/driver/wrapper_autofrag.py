def auto_fragments(molecule: core.Molecule = None, seed_atoms: List = None) -> core.Molecule:
    r"""Detects fragments in unfragmented molecule using BFS algorithm.
    Currently only used for the WebMO implementation of SAPT.

    Parameters
    ----------
    molecule : :ref:`molecule <op_py_molecule>`, optional
        The target molecule, if not the last molecule defined.
    seed_atoms
        List of lists of atoms (0-indexed) belonging to independent fragments.
        Useful to prompt algorithm or to define intramolecular fragments through
        border atoms. Example: `[[1, 0], [2]]`

    Returns
    -------
    :py:class:`~psi4.core.Molecule` |w--w| fragmented molecule in
    Cartesian, fixed-geom (no variable values), no dummy-atom format.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # [1] prepare unfragmented (and non-adjacent-atom) HHFF into (HF)_2 molecule ready for SAPT
    >>> molecule mol {\nH 0.0 0.0 0.0\nH 2.0 0.0 0.0\nF 0.0 1.0 0.0\nF 2.0 1.0 0.0\n}
    >>> print mol.nfragments()  # 1
    >>> fragmol = auto_fragments()
    >>> print fragmol.nfragments()  # 2

    """
    # Make sure the molecule the user provided is the active one
