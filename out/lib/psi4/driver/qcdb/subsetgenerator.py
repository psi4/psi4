"""Module containing functions that, when passed a qcdb.WrappedDatabase instance
*dbinstance*, return an array of reaction names that are a subset of
dbinstance.hrxn.keys(). Since the full database is passed in, reactions
can be filtered by molecule characteristics, reaction names, existing
subsets, etc. The official name of the subset is specified by the function
docstring. Second line of docstring becomes tagl.
