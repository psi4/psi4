# TODO: Include gradient loading feature, analagously to hessian loading.


def to_string(grad, handle, dtype='file11', mol=None, energy=None):
    """Writes gradient in various formats.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grad : ndarray
        (nat, 3) gradient array.
    handle : filename or file handle
        If file handle, it must have been opened in binary, `wb`.
    dtype : {'file11', 'GRD', 'minimal'}, optional
        Format to write Hessian.
            file11 is an old file format with the number of atoms, last energy and geometry, as well as gradient.
            GRD is an ACESII file format with the number of atoms and geometry, as well as gradient.
            minimal simply gives the number of atoms and the gradient.
    mol : psi4.molecule or qcdb.molecule
        The molecule the gradient is from. Needed only in file11 formatting.
    energy : psi4.molecule or qcdb.molecule
        The electronic energy of the molecule the gradient is evaluated from. Needed only in file11 format.

    Returns
    -------
    None
