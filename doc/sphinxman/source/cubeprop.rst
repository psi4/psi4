Generation of Cube Files |w---w| :py:func:`~psi4.cubeprop`

Introduction
------------

|PSIfour| has the ability to export cube files that store information about
basis functions, molecular orbitals, the electron density, and
the electrostatic potential (ESP).  Cube files store the value of a scalar
quantity on a regular Cartesian grid, and can be visualized with several
visualization programs, some of which are free, like VMD
(http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/).

An example utilization of the code is::

   molecule h2o {
   0 1
   O
   H 1 1.0
   H 1 1.0 2 104.5
   }

   set basis cc-pvdz
   set scf_type df
   set freeze_core True
   set cubeprop_tasks ['orbitals']
   set cubeprop_orbitals [5,6,-5,-6]

   E, wfn = energy('scf', return_wfn=True)
   cubeprop(wfn)

In this example, the :py:func:`~p4util.cubeprop`
call after the ``energy('scf')`` command
executes the cubeprop code.  The array |globals__cubeprop_tasks| specifies which
tasks should be executed.  In this case the task ``'orbitals'`` generates cube
files for orbitals.  The |globals__cubeprop_orbitals| option specifies that cube files
should be generated only for alpha orbitals 5 (HOMO) and 6 (LUMO) and
beta orbitals 5 (indicated as -5) and 6.
If the option |globals__cubeprop_orbitals| is not provided, then cube files are
generated for all orbitals.
After running, the above input will generate four files: ``Psi_a_5_1-B1.cube``,
``Psi_a_6_4-A1.cube``, ``Psi_a_5_1-B1.cube``, and ``Psi_a_6_4-A1.cube``. The subscript ``a`` in
``Psi_a_5_1-B1.cube`` indicates an alpha orbital. The first number (``5``) is the index of the
orbital while ``1-B1`` indicates that this is the first orbital that belongs to the B1 irrep.
The file ``Psi_a_5_1-B1.cube`` begins with two comment lines::

   Psi4 Gaussian Cube File.
   Property: Psi_a_5_1-B1. Isocontour range for 85% of the density: (0.0787495,-0.0787495)

The second line reports the isocontour values that capture 85% of the probability density using
the least amount of grid points. This quantity is determined for orbitals and densities. The
fraction of the density captured by the isocontour values is by default 0.85, but can
be changed via the option |globals__cubeprop_isocontour_threshold|.

.. note:: If your cube plots are too coarse, try to decrease the grid spacing via
    the option |globals__cubic_grid_spacing|.  If the edges of your plot are cut then
    increase the size of the grid via the option |globals__cubic_grid_overage|.

Cubeprop Tasks
--------------

The cubeprop utility can be provided a list of tasks to perform.
Tasks are specified by the |globals__cubeprop_tasks| option, which is a list of strings
that identify the tasks.  Several tasks are available. These include:

ORBITALS [Default if  |globals__cubeprop_tasks| is not specified]
    Produces cube representations of the molecular orbitals
    :math:`\psi_q(\mathbf{r})`.  Orbitals are sorted according to increasing
    orbital energy ignoring symmetry.
FRONTIER_ORBITALS
    Produces cube representations of the frontier molecular orbitals. For closed shell
    species, the highest occupied (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied (LUMO) alpha orbitals (ie. 
    :math:`\psi_{\alpha}(\mathbf{r})`) are printed, while for open shell species a total 
    of :math:`(4 + M_s)` orbitals are printed (:math:`\alpha` and :math:`\beta` 
    spin for both lowest virtual (LVMO) and highest doubly occupied
    orbitals (DOMO), along with all :math:`\alpha` singly occupied (SOMO) orbitals).
DENSITY
    This task can be used to obtain the alpha and beta electron densities,
    :math:`\rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r})` and :math:`\rho_\beta(\mathbf{r})`, together
    with the total density
    :math:`\rho(\mathbf{r}) = \rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r}) + \rho_\beta(\mathbf{r})`,
    and the spin density
    :math:`\rho(\mathbf{r}) = \rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r}) - \rho_\beta(\mathbf{r})`.
BASIS_FUNCTIONS
    This task is useful to produce cube files of the atomic orbital basis
    functions :math:`\chi_\mu(\mathbf{r})`.
ESP
    Calculates the total (nuclear + electronic) electrostatic potential
    :math:`V(\mathbf{r})`.
DUAL_DESCRIPTOR
    Calculates the dual descriptor from frontier orbitals:
    :math:`f^2(\mathbf{r})=\rho_{\mathrm{LUMO}}(\mathbf{r})-\rho_{\mathrm{HOMO}}(\mathbf{r})`.
    The dual descriptor is a good measure of nucleophilicity and electrophilicity,
    containing information essentially equivalent to both Fukui functions combined. 
    More details on the dual descriptor itself can be found in [Morell:2005:205]_, 
    while the current implementation is described in [Martinez-Araya:2015:451]_. 
    This feature is currently only supported for closed shell systems.

.. note:: The ``ESP`` task requires the user to specify a density-fitting basis
    via the |scf__df_basis_scf| keyword.

.. warning:: It is important to specify the |globals__cubeprop_orbitals| option when
   dealing with large molecules to avoid running out of disk space.
   For example, using the default grid spacing of
   0.2 |Angstrom|, the size of a single cube file for a molecule like water
   is of the order of 1.4 MB.  For a molecule with 200 basis functions, the cube
   files for all the orbitals occupy more than half a GB.

Orbital Visualization with VMD
==============================

Included in |PSIfour| is functionality to automatically render specified surfaces, including molecular orbitals,
densities, and basis functions, using VMD. The vmd_cube.py script takes the .cube files generated
in a calculation and generates images aligned with user-input specifications. The script is located
in :source:`psi4/share/psi4/scripts/vmd_cube.py`.

Script Prerequisites
--------------------

1. VMD must be installed, and it can be downloaded for free at (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). Additionally,
   the script needs to know where to find the VMD executable, and this is defined as :envvar:`VMDPATH`. VMDPATH must be defined as
   an environment variable.

2. To generate images with multiple surfaces, ImageMagick must also be installed. ImageMagick is a free program which
   can be installed using homebrew/pip or from http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php .

3. With ImageMagick installed, an environment variable called :envvar:`MONTAGE` needs to be created which points to the montage executable.
   This executable can be found in the /bin/ sub-directory wherever ImageMagick was installed.


Running the Script
------------------

1. Run a |PSIfour| calculation, generating .cube files as detailed in the above documentation.

2. Add vmd_cube.py to your path. Call vmd_cube.py and pass the directory containing
   the .cube files as an argument::
	
	python vmd_cube.py /path/to/cube/files/

   By default the script will search for cube files in the directory in which it is called.
   In addition to individual image files for each orbital, vmd_cube will also generate an image containing all surfaces in an array
   (very useful for hand-picking orbital spaces)

3. As an example, take the cube files generated from the water calculation from the above input file.
   Using vmd_cube the alpha molecular orbitals can be rendered and output in one image with::

  python vmd_cube.py /path/to/cube/files/ --opacity=0.5 --rx=90 --ry=60

The desired image in this case is called "AlphaMOs.tga", and looks like	this:

.. image:: /AlphaMOs.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 100%
    :alt: Alpha MOs
