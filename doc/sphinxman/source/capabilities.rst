Capabilities and Alternate Implementations
==========================================

Depending on the reference (e.g., RHF, UHF, ROHF), the integral treatment
(conventional CONV, density-fitted DF, and Cholesky-decomposed CD),
active orbitals, and derivative level, computational methods are
sometimes assembled from implementations by multiple coders. Conversely,
some capabilities may be implemented multiple times. Capabilities,
modules, algorithm types, and defaults are detailed for many ground-state
methods at Table :ref:`Module Capabilities <table:managedmethods>`. Its
analogous summary table (with modules collapsed) is at :ref:`Summary
Capabilities <table:stdsuite>`. |PSIfour| transparently selects the
most efficient implementation, so one generally needn't consult this
table. However, to understand the details of what combinations are
accessible or what alternate implementations are available, read on.

Note that HF, DFT, and MPn (n<=3)
default to density-fitted integrals, while all higher methods default to
conventional integrals. Therefore, for a closed-shell molecule::

    # runs MP2 with default algorithm type ``DF`` with default implementation DFMP2
    energy('mp2')

    # runs MP2 with algorithm type ``CONV`` with default implementation OCC
    set mp2_type conv
    energy('mp2')

    # runs MP2 with default algorithm type ``DF`` with implementation OCC
    set qc_module occ
    energy('mp2')

    # runs MP2 with algorithm type ``CONV`` with implementation FNOCC
    set mp2_type conv
    set qc_module fnocc
    energy('mp2')
