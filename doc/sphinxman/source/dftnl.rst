DFT-NL
======

.. codeauthor:: Daniel G. A. Smith and Holger Kruse
.. sectionauthor:: Holger Kruse

Non-local (NL), density based correlation energy from the VV10 kernel can be added
to arbitrary functionals.

.. math:: E_{DFT-NL}=E_{DFT}+E_{NL}

For pre-defined functionals (see Functional overview in :ref:`this Table <table:dft_all>` ) it is sufficient to add `-NL` to
the functional name::

    energy('b3lyp-nl')

Modification of the parameters `b` and `C` is done setting |scf__dft_vv10_b| and |scf__dft_vv10_c|. The `C` is usually left unchanged and the originally proposed
value of `C=0.0093` is used.

Adding |scf__dft_vv10_b| to any functional activates the calculation of the VV10 kernel. A BLYP-NL calculation can be set as follows::

    set DFT_VV10_B 4.0
    energy('blyp')

The default `C` parameter will be used.

Similar to |scf__dft_dispersion_parameters| the tuple |scf__nl_dispersion_parameters| can used::

    set NL_DISPERSION_PARAMTERS [4.0]
    energy('blyp')

which is equivalent to the example above.

Further examples can be found in the respective :source:`regression test <tests/dft-vv10/input.dat>`

post-SCF time savings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Substantial time-savings for energy calculations are available by evaluating the VV10 kernel only at the converged electron density, i.e. in a post-SCF fashion.
The deviations from the fully self-consistent treatment are usually minimal. To activate this set |scf__dft_vv10_postscf| to `true`.
