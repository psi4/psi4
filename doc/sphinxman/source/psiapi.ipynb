    "\n",
    "**Note:** Psithon and PsiAPI refer to two modes of interacting with Psi4. In Psithon mode, you write an input file in our domain-specific language (not quite Python) where commands don't have ``psi4.`` in front, then submit it to the executable ``psi4`` which processes the Psithon into pure Python and runs it internally. In PsiAPI mode, you write a pure Python script with ``import psi4`` at the top and commands are behind the ``psi4.`` namespace, then submit it to the ``python`` interpreter. Both modes are equally powerful. This tutorial covers the PsiAPI mode.\n",

    "**Warning:** Although the developers have been using PsiAPI mode stably for months before the 1.1 release and while we believe we've gotten everything nicely arranged within the ``psi4.`` namespace, the API should not be considered completely stable. Most importantly, as we someday deprecate the last of the global variables, options will be added to the method calls (*e.g.*, ``energy('scf', molecule=mol, options=opt)``)\n",

    "Note: The arguments to the functions we've used so far, like ``psi4.set_options()`` [API](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/api/psi4.driver.set_options.html), ``psi4.set_module_options()`` [API](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/api/psi4.driver.set_module_options.html), ``psi4.energy()`` [API](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/api/psi4.driver.energy.html#psi4.driver.energy), ``psi4.optimize()`` [API](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/api/psi4.driver.optimize.html#psi4.driver.optimize), ``psi4.frequency()`` [API](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/api/psi4.driver.frequency.html#psi4.driver.frequency), etc., are case-insensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to our SAPT example, we have found that for basic-level SAPT computations (*i.e.*, SAPT0), a good error cancellation is found [(Hohenstein:2012:WIREs)](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/bibliography.html#hohenstein-2012-wires \"Go to References\") with the jun-cc-pVDZ basis (this is the usual aug-cc-pVDZ basis, but without diffuse functions on hydrogen and without diffuse $d$ functions on heavy atoms) [(Papajak:2011:10)](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/bibliography.html#papajak-2011-10 \"Go to References\"). So, we'll use that as our standard basis set.  The SAPT code is designed to use density fitting techniques, because they introduce minimal errors while providing much faster computations [(Hohenstein:2010:184111, ](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/bibliography.html#hohenstein-2010-184111 \"Go to References\")[Hohenstein:2010:014101)](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/bibliography.html#hohenstein-2010-014101 \"Go to References\").  Since we're using density fitting for the SAPT, we might as well also use it for the Hartree-Fock computations that are performed as part of the SAPT.  We can specify that by adding `'scf_type': 'df'` to the dictionary passed to `psi4.set_options()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Density fitting procedures require the use of auxiliary basis sets that pair with the primary basis set.  Fortunately, Psi4 is usually smart enough to figure out what auxiliary basis sets are needed for a given computation.  In this case, jun-cc-pVDZ is a standard enough basis set (just a simple truncation of the very popular aug-cc-pVDZ basis set) that Psi4 correctly guesses that we want the jun-cc-pVDZ-JKFIT auxiliary basis for the Hartree-Fock, and the jun-cc-pVDZ-RI basis set for the SAPT procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "To speed up the computation a little, we also tell the SAPT procedure to freeze the core electrons by adding `'freeze_core': 'true'` to the dictionary passed to `psi4.set_options()`.  The SAPT procedure is invoked by `psi4.energy('sapt0/jun-cc-pvdz', molecule=dimer)`.  Here, Psi4 knows to automatically run two monomer computations and a dimer computation and then use these results to perform the SAPT analysis.  The various energy components are printed at the end of the output, in addition to the total SAPT0 interaction energy.  An explanation of the various energy components can be found in the review by Jeziorski, Moszynski, and Szalewicz [(Jeziorski:1994:1887)](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/bibliography.html#jeziorski-1994-1887 \"Go to References\"), and this is discussed in more detail in the [SAPT section](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/sapt.html \"Go to Manual\") of the Psi4 manual.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we'll note that most of the SAPT energy components are negative; this means those are attractive contributions (the zero of energy in a SAPT computation is defined as non-interacting monomers). The exchange contributions are positive (repulsive). In this example, the most attractive contribution between ethylene and acetylene is an electrostatic term of $-2.12$ kcal/mol (`Elst10,r` where the 1 indicates the first-order perturbation theory result with respect to the intermolecular interaction, and the 0 indicates zeroth-order with respect to the intramolecular electron correlation).  The next most attractive contribution is the `Disp20` term (second order intermolecular dispersion, which looks like MP2 in which one excitation is placed on each monomer), contributing an attraction of $-1.21$ kcal/mol.  It is not surprising that the electrostatic contribution is dominant, because the geometry chosen for this example has the acetylene perpendicular to the ethylene, with the acetylene hydrogen pointing directly at the double bond in ethylene; this will be attractive because the H atoms in acetylene bear a partial positive charge, while the electron rich double bond in ethylene bears a partial negative charge.  At the same time, the dispersion interaction should be smaller because the perpendicular geometry does not allow much overlap between the monomers.  Hence, the SAPT analysis helps clarify (and quantify) our physical understanding about the interaction between the two monomers."

    "## V. Potential Surface Scans and Counterpoise Correction Made Easy\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's consider an example which highlights the advantages of being able to interact with Psi4 directly with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to do a limited potential energy surface scan, such as computing the interaction energy between two neon atoms at various interatomic distances.  One simple but unappealing way to do this is to generate separate geometries for each distance to be studied.  Instead, we can leverage Python loops and string formatting to make our lives simpler.  Additionally, let's suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) correction to compute interaction energies.  Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the dimer basis.  Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard procedure for intermolecular interactions, Psi4 knows about it and has a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction.  It only needs to know what method you want to do the couterpoise correction on (here, let's consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what's monomer A and what's monomer B.  This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the `psi4.geometry()` string can be used to separate monomers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we're going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne$_2$ at a series of different interatomic distances.  And let's print out a table of the interatomic distances we've considered,  and the CP-corrected CCSD(T) interaction energies (in kcal/mol) at each geometry:"

    "First, you can see the geometry string `ne2_geometry` has a two dashes to separate the monomers from each other.  Also note we've used a Z-matrix to specify the geometry, and we've used a variable (`R`) as the interatomic distance.  We have *not* specified the value of `R` in the `ne2_geometry` string like we normally would.  That's because we are going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface, by using a Python loop over the list of interatomic distances `Rvals`.  Before we are able to pass our molecule to Psi4, we need to do two things.  First, we must set the value of the intermolecular separation in our Z-matrix (by using [Python 3 string formatting](https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/string.html#format-examples \"Python Documentation\")) to the particular value of R.  Second, we need to turn the Z-matrix string into a Psi4 molecule, by passing it to [`psi4.geometry()`](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/api/psi4.driver.geometry.html#psi4.driver.geometry \"API Details\").  The argument `bsse_type='cp'` tells Psi4 to perform counterpoise (CP) correction on the dimer to compute the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ interaction energy, which is stored in our `ecp` dictionary at each iteration of our Python loop.  Note that we didn't need to specify ghost atoms, and we didn't need to call the monomer and dimer computations separately. Psi4 does it all for us, automatically.\n",
