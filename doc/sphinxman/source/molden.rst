Interface to Molden, :py:func:`~driver.molden`
==============================================

.. codeauthor:: Justin M. Turney
.. sectionauthor:: C. David Sherrill

|PSIfour| contains an interface to the Molden program.  Molden is a 
visualization program for electronic structure developed by Gijs Schaftenaar
at the University of of Nijmegen, Netherlands.  It is available at 
`http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/molden/ <http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/molden/>`_.  Molden can
plot atomic orbitals, densities, electrostatic potentials (ESP's), etc.  
|PSIfour| can create a file containing
atomic coordinates, basis set, and SCF orbital coefficients in the 
so-called Molden format.  This file is
written by the SCF module (see Section :ref:`SCF <sec:scf>`) 
if the user sets the |scf__molden_write| keyword to true.  This Molden file is 
also used to pass information between |PSIfour| and WebMO, if |PSIfour| 
computations are invoked using the WebMO GUI.  The filename of the 
Molden file ends in ".molden", and the prefix is determined by 
|globals__writer_file_label| (if set), or else by the name of the output
file plus the name of the current molecule. If |scf__molden_with_virtual|
is set to false, the unoccupied orbitals are not written to the Molden
file.
