This document proposes using a (much more informal) version of Python's
PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal `PEP1
<http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/>`_) protocol to organize
|PSIfour|. Presently, topics are brought up on e-mail threads (where
discussion is very temporally localized and not everyone is aware of it
unless cc'd), are brought up at workshops (where people may be absent, no
record is left, and not everyone may have prepared a position on the
topic), or agreed between a couple people over g-chat (others remain
unaware of plans), or planned by someone (who may not have committed those
plans to a ticket or who wants general approval before restructuring the
code).

Path of a PsiPEP
----------------

* Someone creates a file ``psi4/doc/sphinxman/source/pepXXXX.rst`` modeled
  on :source:`doc/sphinxman/source/pep0000model.rst` and adds
  it to ``STATICDOC`` in :source:`doc/sphinxman/Makefile.in`. The file
  should have header fields modeled on another PsiPEP and a discussion of
  the proposed change or practice.

* Anyone can comment by adding sections to the bottom of the reST file.
  Alternatively, e-mail discussions can go out and the (possibly edited)
  results be pasted into the bottom of the reST file once the furor dies
  down.

* Comments can be simple statements of agreement (useful for gauging
  consensus), notation of possible problems, proposed re-writes of the
  proposal, etc.  Only the original author or his designate should change
  the main body of the PsiPEP (to maintain a history).

* Once there's agreement, file can be stamped final and be placed into
  effect. (Yes, this is very vague.)

Roles of a PsiPEP Include
-------------------------

* **Best practices or re-vamped best practices** 

  Practices can be easily linked- or referred-to by number and can be
  tagged as obsolete by a single label change months later.

* **Request/present viewpoint on organization**

  Draw attention to organization needed in code outside one's area of
  expertise. Request interface for some structure (*e.g.*, gradients) or
  viewpoints on how that interface will behave to ensure compatibility.
  Offer philosophy on how processes/definitions should be.

* **Fair Warning: Proposal to change things up**

  Announce plans to re-organize code structure or how something is
  handled. List goals (may be conflicting) and how proposed scheme best
  satisfies them. PsiPEP allows discussion before roll-out in case
  proposal has deleterious side-effects.

The contrast between a PsiPEP and a ticket is that for the latter, there's
no question of whether the task is to be done as described.
