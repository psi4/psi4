How to Ignore the Bots
----------------------

Formatting and analysis bots are great because it takes more effort
to defy them than to accept their criticism. Nevertheless, for code
clarity, they can be honestly wrong, so we need a way to specifically
clear their findings.

* Py Formatting (yapf) ``# yapf: disable`` (single line or block)  ``# yapf: enable`` (resume)

* C++ Formatting (clang-format)  ``// clang-format off`` (single line or block) ``// clang-format on`` (resume)

* Py Dynamic Analysis (coverage.py)  ``# pragma: no cover``

* C++ Dynamic Analysis (gcov) https://stackoverflow.com/a/30078276 untested

* Py Static Analysis (lgtm) ``# lgtm[py/not-named-self]`` (click on the "?" to get the "Query ID")

* C++ Static Analysis (lgtm) ``// lgtm[cpp/wrong-type-format-argument]`` (click on the "?" to get the "Query ID")
