.. table:: Detailed orbital-optimized capabilities of the OCC module. "✓" is runs analytically. Single underline "✓̲" is default module when |globals__qc_module| unspecified. Double underline "✓̳" is default algorithm type when type selector (e.g., |globals__cc_type|\ ) unspecified.

.. [#c1] Algorithm type selection keyword below. Values to the right: conventional ``CV``, density-fitted ``DF``, and Cholesky-decomposed ``CD``.
.. [#c2] Active orbital values to the right: all-electron ``A`` and frozen-core ``F``.
.. [#c3] Finite difference gradients are not marked explicitly by "∷", but the capability can be gleaned from the energy availability.
