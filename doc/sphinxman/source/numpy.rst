Interface to NumPy

Basics
~~~~~~

Converting between the |PSIfour| Data classes and a NumPy array is easy through
various helper functions as detailed in this section.  A quick overview NumPy
functionality can be found `here
<https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html>`_.  In addition,
numerous example of hybrid NumPy and Psi4 can be found at the `Psi4Numpy
project <https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy>`_.  Currently only the Matrix
and Vector objects support NumPy interfacing. Let us begin with a simple
conversion from these objects to a NumPy array::

    >>> import psi4
    >>> import numpy as np

    # Build the Psi4 data objects
    >>> mat = psi4.core.Matrix(3, 3) 
    >>> vec = psi4.core.Vector(3)

    # Convert to a NumPy array
    >>> numpy_mat = np.array(mat)
    >>> numpy_vec = np.array(vec)

Here the data is copied into new NumPy arrays. NumPy arrays can be converted
back to |PSIfour| objects using the ``from_array`` interface::

    >>> new_mat = psi4.core.Matrix.from_array(mat)
    >>> new_vec = psi4.core.Vector.from_array(vec)


NumPy Views
~~~~~~~~~~~

Copying the data between NumPy and Psi4 objects can lead to excessive data
movement and convoluted code. Here we introduce the idea of "Views" where the
same data can be viewed by multiple objects. However, this can lead to very
subtle errors if used incorrectly and care needs to be taken when using these
views.  Views can be created in two ways::

    >>> numpy_mat_view = np.asarray(mat)

    # Access the NumPy object and set all values to 1 through broadcasting
    >>> numpy_mat_view[:] = 1
    
    >>> print(np.array(mat))
    [[ 1.  1.  1.]
     [ 1.  1.  1.]
     [ 1.  1.  1.]]


Secondly, these objects have a ``.np`` attribute for easy access to the underlying data::

    >>> mat.np[:] = 1

this operation is identical to the above.


|PSIfour| Data Objects with Irreps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|PSIfour| data objects natively support multiple :ref:`irreducible representations
<sec:symmetry>`
which is quite useful for Quantum Chemistry. However, this is not fundamental
to NumPy and some work around are required to natively support these
operations. Take the following irreped Matrix::

    >>> dim = psi4.core.Dimension.from_list([1, 2, 3])
    >>> irreped_mat = psi4.core.Matrix("New Matrix", dim, dim)

    # Create a list of Psi4 arrays
    >>> list_of_arrays = irreped_mat.to_array()

    # Or, use the .nph irreped accessor
    >>> irreped_mat.nph[0][:] = 1

Where ``.nph`` is the irreped accessor form. If ``.np`` or ``np.array`` are
called on irreped Matrices or Vectors an error will be thrown; however, the
irreped form is always valid for non-irreped matrices.
