Theoretical Methods: SCF to FCI
===============================

Several electronic structure methods are available in the |PSIfour|
package, from Hartree--Fock molecular orbital theory to coupled-cluster
theory to full configuration interaction.  This section introduces
the methods available and some of their most common input parameters.
A complete list of standard keywords is provided in Appendix
:ref:`apdx:options_c_module`.
