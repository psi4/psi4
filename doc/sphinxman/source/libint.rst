Interface to Libint by E. Valeev

|PSIfour|, particularly libmints utterly relies upon the Libint library
developed by E. Valeev from early roots by J. Fermann. Libint requires no
additional licence, downloads, or configuration. Conversely, |Psifour|
cannot build *without* Libint.

.. note:: As of Nov 2020 or release v1.4, |PSIfour| uses Libint2, not Libint1.
   Compared to many other open-source QC codes, |PSIfour| requires a separate
   Libint compilation with a different integrals ordering. See notes at top of
   https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/master/external/upstream/libint2/CMakeLists.txt

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Binary**

* .. image:: https://anaconda.org/psi4/libint/badges/version.svg
     :target: https://anaconda.org/psi4/libint

* Libint is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS (and Windows, through the Ubuntu shell).

* If using the |PSIfour| binary, Libint has already been installed alongside.

* If using |PSIfour| built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has
  already been installed (instructions at :ref:`sec:quickconda`),
  Libint can be obtained through ``conda install libint -c psi4``.
  Then, hint its location with :makevar:`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`,
  and rebuild |PSIfour| to detect Libint and activate dependent code.

.. * Previous bullet had details. To build |PSIfour| from source and use 
..   Libint from conda without thinking, consult.

* To remove a conda installation, ``conda remove libint``.

**Source**

* .. image:: https://img.shields.io/github/tag/evaleev/libint.svg?maxAge=2592000
     :target: https://github.com/evaleev/libint/tree/v1

  Note that |PSIfour| uses v1.

* If using |PSIfour| built from source and you want Libint built from
  from source also,
  let the build system fetch and build it and activate dependent code.

How to configure Libint for building Psi4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Role and Dependencies**

* Role |w---w| In |PSIfour|, Libint is a library that provides essential
  two-body molecular integrals over Gaussian functions.

* Downstream Dependencies |w---w| |PSIfour| |dr| Libint

* Upstream Dependencies |w---w| Libint |dr| None

**CMake Variables**

* :makevar:`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` |w---w| CMake list variable to specify where pre-built dependencies can be found. For Libint, set to an installation directory containing ``include/libint/libint.h``
* :makevar:`Libint_DIR` |w---w| CMake variable to specify where pre-built Libint can be found. Set to installation directory containing ``share/cmake/Libint/LibintConfig.cmake``
* :makevar:`CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_Libint` |w---w| CMake variable to force internal build of Libint instead of detecting pre-built
* :makevar:`CMAKE_INSIST_FIND_PACKAGE_Libint` |w---w| CMake variable to force detecting pre-built Libint and not falling back on internal build
* :makevar:`MAX_AM_ERI` |w---w| CMake variable to specify minimum highest angular momentum built or detected

**Examples**

A. Build bundled

  .. code-block:: bash

    >>> cmake

B. Link against pre-built

  .. code-block:: bash

    >>> cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/libint/root

  .. code-block:: bash

    >>> cmake -DLibint_DIR=/path/to/libint/configdir

C. Build bundled despite pre-built being detectable

  .. code-block:: bash

    >>> cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/unwanted/libint/root/and/wanted/other/dependencies/root -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_Libint=ON

D. Build bundled shared library with AM=6

  .. code-block:: bash

    >>> cmake -DMAX_AM_ERI=6 -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
