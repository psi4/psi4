Interface to Libint by E. Valeev

|PSIfour|, particularly libmints utterly relies upon the Libint library
developed by E. Valeev from early roots by J. Fermann. Libint requires no
additional licence, downloads, or configuration. Conversely, |Psifour|
cannot build *without* Libint.

.. note:: As of Nov 2020 or release v1.4, |PSIfour| uses Libint2, not Libint1.
   Compared to many other open-source QC codes, |PSIfour| requires a separate
   Libint compilation with a different integrals ordering. See notes at top of
   :source:`external/upstream/libint2/CMakeLists.txt` .

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Binary**

* .. image:: https://anaconda.org/psi4/libint2/badges/version.svg
     :target: https://anaconda.org/psi4/libint2

* Libint is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS and Windows.

* If using the |PSIfour| binary, Libint has already been installed alongside.

* If using |PSIfour| built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has
  already been installed (instructions at :ref:`sec:quickconda`),
  Libint can be obtained through ``conda install libint2 -c psi4``.
  Then, hint its location with :makevar:`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`,
  and rebuild |PSIfour| to detect Libint and activate dependent code.

.. * Previous bullet had details. To build |PSIfour| from source and use 
..   Libint from conda without thinking, consult.

* To remove a conda installation, ``conda remove libint2``.

**Source**

* .. image:: https://img.shields.io/github/tag/evaleev/libint.svg?maxAge=2592000
     :target: https://github.com/evaleev/libint/pull/233

  Note that |PSIfour| uses v2 and a modified branch.

* If using |PSIfour| built from source and you want Libint built from
  from source also,
  let the build system fetch and build it and activate dependent code.
  Note that Libint2 has many more integral class enabling and AM knobs
  than Libint1 and that the generation step (generator source to
  library source) preceding the compilation step (library source to
  built library) takes far longer than in Libint1 for production builds.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Role and Dependencies**

* Role |w---w| In |PSIfour|, Libint is a library that provides essential
  two-body molecular integrals over Gaussian functions.

* Downstream Dependencies |w---w| |PSIfour| |dr| Libint

* Upstream Dependencies |w---w| Libint |dr| None

**CMake Variables**

* :makevar:`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` |w---w| CMake list variable to specify where pre-built dependencies can be found. For Libint, set to an installation directory containing ``include/libint2.h``
* :makevar:`Libint2_DIR` |w---w| CMake variable to specify where pre-built Libint can be found. Set to installation directory containing ``lib/cmake/libint2/libint2-config.cmake``
* :makevar:`CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_Libint2` |w---w| CMake variable to force internal build of Libint instead of detecting pre-built
* :makevar:`CMAKE_INSIST_FIND_PACKAGE_Libint2` |w---w| CMake variable to force detecting pre-built Libint and not falling back on internal build
* :makevar:`BUILD_Libint2_GENERATOR` |w---w| CMake variable to allow internal build to start from generator source, not generated source
* :makevar:`MAX_AM_ERI` |w---w| CMake variable to specify minimum highest angular momentum built or detected

**Examples**

A. Build bundled

  .. code-block:: bash

    >>> cmake

B. Link against pre-built

  .. code-block:: bash

    >>> cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/libint/root

  .. code-block:: bash

    >>> cmake -DLibint_DIR2=/path/to/libint/configdir

C. Build bundled despite pre-built being detectable

  .. code-block:: bash

    >>> cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/unwanted/libint/root/and/wanted/other/dependencies/root -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_Libint2=ON

D. Build bundled shared library with up to AM=5

  .. code-block:: bash

    >>> cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON

E. Build custom library from generator source

  .. code-block:: bash

    >>> # find the "new-cmake-harness-lab-rb1" block at :source:`external/upstream/libint2/CMakeLists.txt`
    >>> # edit the "ENABLE" and "AM" variables
    >>> cmake -DBUILD_Libint2_GENERATOR=ON -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_Libint2=ON
