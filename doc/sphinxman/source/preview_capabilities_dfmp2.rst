.. [#m1] Algorithm type selection keyword below. Values to the right: conventional ``CV``, density-fitted ``DF``, and Cholesky-decomposed ``CD``.
.. [#m2] Active orbital values to the right: all-electron ``A`` and frozen-core ``F``.
.. [#m3] Finite difference gradients are not marked explicitly by "∷", but the capability can be gleaned from the energy availability.
.. [#m10] Also available for DFT references RKS/UKS
