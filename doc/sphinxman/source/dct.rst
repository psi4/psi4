Theory
~~~~~~

Density cumulant theory (DCT) is a density-based *ab initio* theory
that can compute electronic energies without the use of a wavefunction. The
theory starts by writing the exact energy expression in terms of the one- and
two-particle density matrices (:math:`\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}` and :math:`\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}`):

.. math:: 

    E = h_p^q \gamma_q^p + \frac{1}{2} g_{pq}^{rs} \gamma_{rs}^{pq}

Here we used Einstein convention for the summation over the repeated indices.
:math:`h_p^q` and :math:`g_{pq}^{rs}` are the standard one- and two-electron integrals, and
:math:`\gamma_p^q` and :math:`\gamma_{pq}^{rs}` are the elements of :math:`\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}` and :math:`\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}`,
respectively. Naively, one might expect that it is possible to minimize the
energy functional in the equation above and obtain the exact energy. This is,
however, not trivial, as the density matrix elements :math:`\gamma_p^q` and
:math:`\gamma_{pq}^{rs}` cannot be varied arbitrarily, but must satisfy some
conditions that make sure that the density matrices are N-representable, *i.e.*
correspond to an antisymmetric N-electron wavefunction. Unfortunately, no
simple set of necessary and sufficient N-representability conditions are known,
and some of the known conditions are not easily imposed. In addition, the lack
of separability of the density matrices may result in the loss of
size-consistency and size-extensivity. In DCT, one takes a different route and
replaces :math:`\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}` in favor of its two-particle density cumulant:

.. math:: 

    \lambda_{pq}^{rs} = \gamma_{pq}^{rs} - \gamma_p^r \gamma_q^s + \gamma_p^s \gamma_q^r

The one-particle density matrix is separated into its idempotent part
:math:`\boldsymbol{\kappa}` and a correction :math:`\boldsymbol{\tau}`:

.. math:: 

    \gamma_p^q = \kappa_p^q + \tau_p^q

The idempotent part of :math:`\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}` corresponds to a mean-field Hartree--Fock-like density,
while the non-idempotent correction :math:`\boldsymbol{\tau}`
depends on the density cumulant and describes the electron correlation effects.
Inserting the above two equations into the energy expression, we obtain:

.. math:: 

    E_{DCT} = \frac{1}{2} \left( h_p^q + f_p^q \right) \gamma_q^p  + \frac{1}{4} \bar{g}_{pq}^{rs} \lambda_{rs}^{pq}

where the antisymmetrized two-electron integrals and the generalized Fock operator
matrix elements were defined as follows:

.. math:: 

    \bar{g}_{pq}^{rs} = g_{pq}^{rs} - g_{pq}^{sr}

.. math:: 

    f_p^q = h_p^q + \bar{g}_{pr}^{qs} \gamma_{s}^{r}

Energy functional :math:`E_{DCT}` has several important properties. First,
the energy is now a function of two sets of independent parameters, the
idempotent part of :math:`\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}` (:math:`\boldsymbol{\kappa}`) and the density cumulant
(:math:`\boldsymbol{\lambda_2}`). As a result, the energy functional is Hermitian,
which is important for the evaluation of the molecular properties. The additive
separability of the density cumulant guarantees that all of the DCT methods
are size-extensive and size-consistent. Furthermore, the N-representability
problem is now greatly simplified, because the idempotent part of :math:`\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}` is
N-representable by construction. One only needs to worry about the
N-representability of the density cumulant, which is a relatively small part of
:math:`\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}`.

In order to obtain the DCT energy, two conditions must be satisfied:

1) The energy must be stationary with respect to a set of orbitals. This can be done by
   diagonalizing the generalized Fock operator (as in the DC-06 and DC-12 methods, see below),
   which introduces partial orbital relaxation, or by fully relaxing the orbitals and minimizing the entire energy expression
   (as in the ODC-06 and ODC-12 methods).

2) The energy must be stationary with respect to the variation of the density
   cumulant :math:`\boldsymbol{\lambda_2}`, constrained to N-representability conditions.

Making the energy stationary requires solution of two sets of coupled
equations for orbitals and density cumulant, respectively (also known as
residual equations). At the present moment, three different algorithms for the
solution of the system of coupled equations are available (see
:ref:`Iterative Algorithms <sec:dctalgorithms>` for details). 

Publications resulting from the use of the DCT code should cite contributions
listed :ref:`here <intro:dctcitations>`.

.. _`sec:dctmethods`:

Methods
~~~~~~~

Currently five DCT methods (functionals) are available: DC-06, DC-12, ODC-06, ODC-12, and ODC-13. The first four 
methods use approximate N-representability conditions derived from 
second-order perturbation theory and differ in the description of the
correlated (non-idempotent) part :math:`\boldsymbol{\tau}` of the one-particle density
matrix and orbital optimization. While in the DC-06 and ODC-06 methods :math:`\boldsymbol{\tau}` is derived from the density cumulant
in an approximate way (labelled by '06'), the DC-12 and ODC-12 methods derive this contribution exactly, and
take full advantage of the N-representability conditions (which is denoted by '12'). The corresponding DC and ODC methods
have similar description of the :math:`\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}` N-representability, but differ in describing the orbital relaxation:
the former methods account for the relaxation only partially, while the latter fully relax the orbitals.
Both DC-06 and DC-12 methods have similar computational cost, same is true when comparing ODC-06 and ODC-12. 
Meanwhile, the DC methods are generally more efficient than their ODC analogs, due to a more expensive orbital update step
needed for the full orbital optimization. In the ODC-13 method, the third- and
fourth-order N-representability conditions are used for the density cumulant
and the correlated contribution :math:`\boldsymbol{\tau}`, respectively,
and the orbitals are variationally optimized. 
For most of the applications, it is recommended to use the ODC-12 method, which
provides an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency, especially for
molecules with open-shell character. If highly accurate results are desired, a
combination of the ODC-13 method with a three-particle energy correction
[:math:`\mbox{ODC-13$(\lambda_3)$}`] can be used (see below).
For the detailed comparison of the quality of these methods, we refer
users to our :ref:`publications <intro:dctcitations>`.

The DCT functional can be specified by the |dct__dct_functional| option. The
default choice is the ODC-12 functional. The DCT code can also be used to
compute the :math:`(\lambda_3)` energy correction that perturbatively accounts
for three-particle correlation effects, similarly to the (T) correction in coupled
cluster theory. Computation of the :math:`(\lambda_3)` correction can be
requested by setting the |dct__three_particle| option to PERTURBATIVE. A
combination of the ODC-13 functional with the  :math:`(\lambda_3)` correction
[denoted as :math:`\mbox{ODC-13$(\lambda_3)$}`] has been shown to provide highly
accurate results for open-shell molecules near equilibrium geometries.

At the present moment, all of the DCT methods support unrestricted reference
orbitals (|scf__reference| ``UHF``), which can be used to perform energy and
gradient computations for both closed- and open-shell molecules. In addition,
the ODC-06 and ODC-12 methods support restricted reference orbitals
(|scf__reference| ``RHF``) for the energy and gradient computations of
closed-shell molecules. Note that in this case restricted reference orbitals
are only available for |dct__algorithm| ``SIMULTANEOUS``.

.. _`sec:dctalgorithms`:

Iterative Algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As explained in the :ref:`Theory <sec:dcttheory>` section, in order to obtain the DCT energy one
needs to solve a system of coupled equations for orbitals and density
cumulant. At the present moment three iterative algorithms for the solution of the
equations are available. The choice of the algorithm is controlled using the
|dct__algorithm| option.

SIMULTANEOUS [Default]
    In the simultaneous algorithm the DCT equations are solved in macroiterations.
    Each macroiteration consists of a single iteration of the cumulant update
    followed by a single iteration of the orbital update and orbital transformation
    of the integrals. The macroiterations are repeated until the simultaneous
    convergence of the cumulant and orbitals is achieved.
    Convergence of the simultaneous algorithm is accelerated using the
    DIIS extrapolation technique.

TWOSTEP
    In the two-step algorithm each macroiteration consists of two sets of
    microiterations. In the first set, the density cumulant equations are solved
    iteratively, while the orbitals are kept fixed. After the density cumulant is
    converged, the second set of microiterations is performed for the
    self-consistent update of the orbitals with the fixed density cumulant. Each
    macroiteration is completed by performing the orbital transformation of the
    integrals. As in the simultaneous algorithm, the DIIS
    extrapolation is used to accelerate convergence. Two-step algorithm is
    only available for the DC-06 and DC-12 methods.

QC
    In the quadratically-convergent algorithm, the
    orbital and cumulant update equations are solved using the Newton-Raphson
    method. Each macroiteration of the quadratically-convergent algorithm consists
    of a single Newton-Raphson update followed by the orbital transformation
    of the integrals. The solution of the Newton-Raphson equations is performed
    iteratively using the preconditioned conjugate gradients method, where only the
    product of the electronic Hessian with the step vector is computed for
    efficiency. By default, the electronic Hessian is build for both the cumulant and orbital
    updates and both updates are performed simultaneously. Setting the |dct__qc_type|
    option to ``TWOSTEP`` will perform the Newton-Raphson update only for the orbitals,
    while the equations for the cumulant will be solved using a standard Jacobi update.
    If requested by the user (set |dct__qc_coupling| to TRUE), the electronic Hessian can include
    matrix elements that couple the orbitals and the density cumulant.
    The computation of these coupling elements increases
    the cost of the macroiteration, but usually leads to faster convergence and is
    recommended for open-shell systems.
    It is important to note that the quadratically-convergent algorithm is not yet fully
    optimized and often converges slowly when the RMS of the cumulant or
    the orbital gradient is below :math:`10^{-7}`.

The choice of the iterative algorithm can significantly affect the cost of the
energy computation. While the two-step algorithm requires a small number of
disk-intensive :math:`{\cal O}(N^5)` integral transformations, the simultaneous
algorithm benefits from a smaller number of expensive :math:`{\cal O}(N^6)`
cumulant updates. As a result, for small closed-shell systems the two-step
algorithm is usually preferred, while for larger systems and molecules with
open-shell character it is recommended to use the simultaneous algorithm.
Efficiency of the simultaneous algorithm can be greatly increased by avoiding
the transformation of the four-index virtual two-electron integrals
:math:`(vv|vv)` and computing the terms that involve these integrals in the AO
basis. In order to do that one needs to set the |dct__ao_basis| option to
DISK (currently used by default). For more recommendations on the choice of the algorithm see
:ref:`Recommendations <sec:dctrecommend>`.

.. _`sec:dctgradients`:

Analytic Gradients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Analytic gradients are available for the DC-06, ODC-06, ODC-12, and ODC-13 methods.
For DC-06, the evaluation of the analytic gradients requires the solution of the
coupled response equations. Two algorithms are available for their iterative
solution: ``TWOSTEP`` (default) and ``SIMULTANEOUS``. These algorithms are similar to those
described for the orbital and cumulant updates in the :ref:`Iterative Algorithms <sec:dctalgorithms>`
section and usually exhibit similar efficiency. The choice of the algorithm can
be made using the |dct__response_algorithm| option. For the DC-12 method the
analytic gradients are not yet available, one has to use numerical gradients to
perform the geometry optimizations. For the ODC-06, ODC-12 and ODC-13 methods no response equations
need to be solved, which makes the computation of the analytic gradients very
efficient. Analytic gradients are not available for the three-particle energy
correction :math:`(\lambda_3)`.

Note that for ODC-06 and ODC-12 |scf__reference| ``RHF`` is only available for
|dct__algorithm| ``SIMULTANEOUS``. To compute :math:`(\lambda_3)` correction,
the |dct__three_particle| option needs to be set to PERTURBATIVE.


.. _`sec:dctmininput`:

Minimal Input
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Minimal input for the DCT single-point computation looks like this::

    molecule { 
    H
    H 1 1.0
    }

    set basis cc-pvdz
    
    energy('dct')

The ``energy('dct')`` call to :py:func:`~psi4.energy` executes the DCT
module, which will first call the SCF module and perform the SCF computation
with RHF reference to obtain a guess for the DCT orbitals. After SCF is
converged, the program will perform the energy computation using the ODC-12
method. By default, simultaneous algorithm will be used for the solution of
the equations. One can also request to perform geometry
optimization following example below::

    molecule { 
    H
    H 1 1.0
    }

    set basis cc-pvdz
    
    optimize('dct')

The ``optimize('dct')`` call will first perform all of the procedures
described above to obtain the ODC-12 energy. After that, the ODC-12 analytic
gradients code will be executed and geometry optimization will be performed. 

.. _`sec:dctrecommend`:

Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a list of recommendations for the DCT module:

* Generally, the use of the simultaneous algorithm together with the
  |dct__ao_basis| ``DISK`` option is recommended (set by default).

* In cases when available memory is insufficient, the use of the |dct__ao_basis| ``DISK`` option
  is recommended. This will significantly reduce the memory requirements. However, when
  used together with the two-step algorithm, this option can significantly
  increase the cost of the energy computation.

* In cases when the oscillatory convergence is observed before the DIIS
  extrapolation is initialized, it is recommended to increase the threshold for
  the RMS of the density cumulant or orbital update residual, below which the
  DIIS extrapolation starts. This can be done by setting the
  |dct__diis_start_convergence| option to the value greater than
  :math:`10^{-3}` by one or two orders of magnitude (*e.g.* :math:`10^{-2}` or
  :math:`10^{-1}`). This can be particularly useful for computations using the
  ODC methods, because it can greatly reduce the number of iterations.

* If oscillatory convergence is observed for atoms or molecules with high
  symmetry, it is recommended to use the quadratically-convergent algorithm.

* When using the quadratically-convergent algorithm for the closed-shell molecules, it
  is recommended to set the |dct__qc_coupling| option to FALSE for efficiency
  reasons (set by default).

* For the ODC computations, the user has a choice of performing the computation of the guess orbitals and cumulants
  using the corresponding DC method (set |dct__odc_guess| to TRUE). This can often lead to
  significant computational savings, since the orbital update step in the DC methods is cheap.
  Convergence of the guess orbitals and cumulants can be controlled using the
  |dct__guess_r_convergence| option.
