.. [#r1] Algorithm type selection keyword below. Values to the right: conventional ``CV``, density-fitted ``DF``, and Cholesky-decomposed ``CD``.
.. [#r2] Active orbital values to the right: all-electron ``A`` and frozen-core ``F``.
.. [#r3] Finite difference gradients are not marked explicitly by "∷", but the capability can be gleaned from the energy availability.
.. [#r4] Finite difference Hessians are not marked explicitly by "∷", but the capability can be gleaned from the gradient or energy availability.
.. [#r10] DH-DFT only available with DF-MP2
