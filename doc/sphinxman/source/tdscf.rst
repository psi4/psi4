Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

|PSIfour| provides the capability to calculate excitation energies and ground to
excited state transition properties for SCF reference wavefunctions in a linear
response formalism [Dreuw2005-wp]_.

An illustrative example of using the TDSCF functionality is as follows::

    molecule {
    0 1
    O        0.000000    0.695000   -0.092486
    O       -0.000000   -0.695000   -0.092486
    H       -0.388142    0.895249    0.739888
    H        0.388142   -0.895249    0.739888
    symmetry c1
    }

    set {
    tdscf_states 10
    }

    energy('td-scf/cc-pvdz')

This will seek to converge 10 singlet roots from a restricted Hartree--Fock reference. The roots are obtained with an iterative eigensolver and the following is the printout from the calculation::

The solvers can be used to extract the first few roots of interest for the full
time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) equations, also known as the random-phase
approximation (RPA), or its Tamm--Dancoff approximation.
The former is a *generalized* eigenvalue problem and our solver leverages
the Hamiltonian structure of the equations to ensure robust convergence [stratmann:1998]_.
The latter is a Hermitian eigenvalue problem and we employ a Davidson solver.

Known limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: The implementation cannot currently handle the following cases:
             - Functionals with meta or VV10 components.

.. warning:: The length-gauge rotatory strengths |PSIfour| computes are
             currently **not** gauge-origin invariant.

Theory
~~~~~~

The excitation energies and corresponding states are obtained from the following generalized
eigenvalue problem, also known as the *response eigenvalue problem*:

.. math::
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \mathbf{A} & \mathbf{B} \\
      \mathbf{B}^{*} & \mathbf{A}^{*}
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \mathbf{X}_{n} \\
      \mathbf{Y}_{n}
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \omega_{n}
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \mathbf{1} & \mathbf{0} \\
      \mathbf{0} & -\mathbf{1}
    \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \mathbf{X}_{n} \\
    \mathbf{Y}_{n}
  \end{pmatrix}.

This approach has the advantage that there is no need to explicitly parametrize
the wavefunctions of the molecular excited states. Furthermore, the excitation
eigenvectors, :math:`(\mathbf{X}_{n} \mathbf{Y}_{n})^{t}`,
provide information on the nature of the transitions and can be used to form
spectroscopic observables, such as oscillator and rotatory strengths.

The :math:`\mathbf{A}` and :math:`\mathbf{B}` matrices appearing on the left-hand side are
the blocks of the molecular electronic
Hessian, [Norman2018-tn]_
whose dimensionality is :math:`(OV)^{2}`, with :math:`O` and :math:`V` the number of occupied and
virtual molecular orbitals, respectively.
This prevents explicit formation of the full Hessian, and subspace iteration
methods need to be used to extract the first few roots.
In such methods, the eigenvectors are expanded in a subspace of trial vectors,
whose dimensionality is greatly lower than that of the full eigenproblem.
The Hessian is projected down to this subspace where conventional full
diagonalization algorithms can be applied. The subspace is augmented with new
trial vectors, until a suitable convergence criterion is met.
The efficiency of the subspace solver is determined by the first half-projection
of the Hessian in the trial subspace, that is, by the efficiency of the routines
performing the matrix-vector products.

It is essential to note that, despite the hermiticity of the molecular
electronic Hessian, the response eigenvalue equation is not an Hermitian
eigenproblem, due to the nonunit metric on the right-hand side. Indeed the Davidson
solver, the standard subspace iteration method in quantum chemistry,
demonstrates very poor convergence, sometimes manifesting as spurious complex
eigenvalues.
The eigenproblem however has Hamiltonian symmetry: the
roots appear in pairs :math:`(\omega_{n}, -\omega_{n})`, as do the eigenvectors.
A robust subspace solver should preserve the Hamiltonian symmetry, by enforcing
the paired structure on the trial vectors themselves.
Since |PSIfour| employs real orbitals, the response eigenproblem can be brought
to the form:

.. math::
  (\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B})(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B})| \mathbf{X}_{n} + \mathbf{Y}_{n}\rangle
  =
  \omega^{2}_{n} | \mathbf{X}_{n} + \mathbf{Y}_{n}\rangle,

and further to the Hermitian form:

.. math::
  (\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B})^{\frac{1}{2}}(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B})(\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B})^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathbf{T}_{n}
  =
  \omega^{2}_{n} \mathbf{T}_{n},

assuming the SCF reference is stable, *i.e.* :math:`(\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{B})` is positive-definite.
The paired vectors :math:`| \mathbf{X}_{n} - \mathbf{Y}_{n}\rangle` are left
eigenvectors and form a biorthonormal set together
with the right eigenvectors :math:`| \mathbf{X}_{n} + \mathbf{Y}_{n}\rangle`.

The algorithm for the subspace iteration Hamiltonian solver implemented in |PSIfour|
was first described by Stratmann *et al.* [stratmann:1998]_.
As already mentioned, the formation and storage of the matrix-vector products
:math:`(\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B})\mathbf{b}_{i}` and
:math:`(\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{B})\mathbf{b}_{i}` for all trial vectors :math:`\mathbf{b}_{i}`
are the most compute- and memory-intensive operations in the Hamiltonian solver.
These matrix-vector products are equivalent to building generalized Fock
matrices and thus use the efficient :math:`JK` build infrastructure of |PSIfour|.

The excitation energies and eigenvectors can then be used to compute transition moments, such as
electric and magnetic transition dipole moments, and spectroscopic intensities,
such as oscillator strengths and rotatory strengths [Pedersen1995-du]_, [Lestrange2015-xn]_.
For example, |PSIfour| will compute compute oscillator strengths from
the MO basis electric dipole moment integrals, :math:`\mathbf{\mu}_{u}`, and the right
excitation vectors, :math:`|\mathbf{X}_{n}+\mathbf{Y}_{n}\rangle`:

.. math::
   f = \frac{2}{3} \omega_{n} \sum_{u=x,y,z}\sum_{ia}|(\mathbf{X}_{n}+\mathbf{Y}_{n})_{ia}\mu_{ai, u}|^{2}.

PsiAPI usage

The TDSCF functionality is also accessible from PsiAPI. The example calculation shown above can be carried out as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   import psi4

   from psi4.driver.procrouting.response.scf_response import tdscf_excitations

   psi4.core.set_output_file("h2o2.out")

Plotting one-photon absorption and electronic circular dichroism spectra
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Excitation energies and corresponding spectroscopic observables can be used to
produce spectra for one-photon absorption (OPA) and electronic circular
dichroism (ECD) with phenomenological line broadening.

|PSIfour| provides the ``spectrum`` function for this purpose implementing the
recommendations of Rizzo *et al.* [Rizzo2011-to]_.
This function will *not* plot the spectrum, but rather return a pair of NumPy
arrays containing the :math:`x` and :math:`y` values resulting from the
convolution with broadening of the computed spectroscopic observables.

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   psi4.set_options({

   })

   e, wfn = psi4.energy("HF/cc-pvdz", return_wfn=True, molecule=moxy)
   res = tdscf_excitations(wfn, states=8, triplets="also")

   # get poles and residues to plot OPA and ECD spectra
   poles = [r["EXCITATION ENERGY"] for r in res]
   opa_residues = [np.linalg.norm(r["LENGTH-GAUGE ELECTRIC DIPOLE TRANSITION MOMENT"])**2 for r in res]
   ecd_residues = [r["LENGTH-GAUGE ROTATORY STRENGTH"] for r in res]

   opa_spectrum = spectrum(poles=poles, residues=opa_residues, gamma=0.01, out_units="nm")
   ecd_spectrum = spectrum(poles=poles, residues=ecd_residues, kind="ECD", gamma=0.01, out_units="nm")


The data produced by running the above PsiAPI code can, for example, be used
with the Altair plotting library to produce the desired spectra.
