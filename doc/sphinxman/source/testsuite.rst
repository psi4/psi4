Test Suite and Sample Inputs
============================

|PSIfour| is distributed with an extensive test suite, which can
be found in :source:`tests`. After building the source code, these
can automatically be run by running ``ctest`` in the compilation
directory. More info on ``ctest`` options can be found
:ref:`here <faq:subsettests>`. Sample input files
can be found in the :source:`samples` subdirectory of the top-level Psi
directory. The samples and a brief description are provided below.

Sample inputs accessible through :ref:`interfaced executables
<sec:interfacing>` are bulleted below.
