|PSIfour|, relies upon the Libxc library for density functionals. Libxc
requires no
additional licence, downloads, or configuration. Conversely, |Psifour|
cannot build *without* Libxc.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Binary**

* .. image:: https://anaconda.org/psi4/libxc/badges/version.svg
     :target: https://anaconda.org/psi4/libxc

* Libxc is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS (and Windows, through the Ubuntu shell).

* If using the |PSIfour| binary, Libxc has already been installed alongside.

* If using |PSIfour| built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has
  already been installed (instructions at :ref:`sec:quickconda`),
  Libxc can be obtained through ``conda install libxc -c psi4``.
  Then, hint its location with :makevar:`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`,
  and rebuild |PSIfour| to detect Libxc and activate dependent code.

.. * Previous bullet had details. To build |PSIfour| from source and use
..   Libxc from conda without thinking, consult.

* To remove a conda installation, ``conda remove libxc``.

**Source**

* .. image:: https://img.shields.io/github/tag/loriab/libxc.svg?maxAge=2592000
     :target: https://github.com/loriab/libxc/tree/libxc4retweaked

  Note that |PSIfour| has forked and slightly modified upstream Libxc from
  https://gitlab.com/libxc/libxc to regain functionality.

* If using |PSIfour| built from source and you want Libxc built from
  from source also,
  let the build system fetch and build it and activate dependent code.

How to configure Libxc for building Psi4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Role and Dependencies**

* Role |w---w| In |PSIfour|, Libxc is a library that provides essential
  density functional definitions and compositions.

* Downstream Dependencies |w---w| |PSIfour| |dr| Libxc

* Upstream Dependencies |w---w| Libxc |dr| None

**CMake Variables**

* :makevar:`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` |w---w| CMake list variable to specify where pre-built dependencies can be found. For Libxc, set to an installation directory containing ``include/libxc/xc.h``
* :makevar:`Libxc_DIR` |w---w| CMake variable to specify where pre-built Libxc can be found. Set to installation directory containing ``share/cmake/Libxc/LibxcConfig.cmake``
* :makevar:`CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_Libxc` |w---w| CMake variable to force internal build of Libxc instead of detecting pre-built
* :makevar:`CMAKE_INSIST_FIND_PACKAGE_Libxc` |w---w| CMake variable to force detecting pre-built Libxc and not falling back on internal build

**Examples**

A. Build bundled

  .. code-block:: bash

    >>> cmake

B. Link against pre-built

  .. code-block:: bash

    >>> cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/libxc/root

  .. code-block:: bash

    >>> cmake -DLibxc_DIR=/path/to/libxc/configdir

C. Build bundled despite pre-built being detectable

  .. code-block:: bash

    >>> cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/unwanted/libxc/root/and/wanted/other/dependencies/root -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_Libxc=ON
