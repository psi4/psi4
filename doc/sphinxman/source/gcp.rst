Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Binary**

* .. image:: https://anaconda.org/psi4/gcp/badges/version.svg
     :target: https://anaconda.org/psi4/gcp

* gCP is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS (and Windows, through the Ubuntu shell).

* If using the Psi4conda installer, gCP has already been installed alongside.

* If using the |PSIfour| conda package, the gcp conda package can
  be obtained through ``conda install gcp -c psi4`` or ``conda install
  psi4-rt -c psi4``.

* If using |PSIfour| built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has
  already been installed (instructions at :ref:`sec:quickconda`),
  the gcp executable can be obtained through ``conda install gcp -c psi4``.

* To remove a conda installation, ``conda remove gcp``.

**Source**

* .. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/home-gCP-5077AB.svg
     :target: https://www.chemie.uni-bonn.de/pctc/mulliken-center/software/gcp/getgcp

* If using |PSIfour| built from source and you want to build gCP from
  from source also, follow the instructions provided with the source
  (essentially, download the freely available tarball, unpack the source,
  edit the Makefile to select a Fortran compiler, and run make).

To be used by |PSIfour|, the program binary (``gcp``) must be
found in your :envvar:`PSIPATH` or :envvar:`PATH` (in that order). If
|PSIfour| is unable to execute the binary, an error will be reported.
To preferentially use a particular gcp compilation, simply adjust its
position in the path environment variables.


Running gCP
~~~~~~~~~~~

At present there is a limited interface to gCP that is used
only to implement the "HF-3c" [Sure:2013:1672]_ and "PBEh-3c"
[Grimme:2015:054107]_ methods (both energy and gradient). The :ref:`DFTD3
<sec:dftd3>` executable must also be available for these methods to
run. Unlike every other method in |PSIfour|, if a basis set has not been
set, these will default to their intended basis sets: MINIX for HF-3c
and def2-mSVP for PBEh-3c. If a basis has previously been set, but you
want to use the default basis, use the slash syntax to "empty" the basis
option for the scope of the current calculation, ``energy("hf3c/")``.

A few practical examples:

* HF-3c single point with default minix basis ::

   energy('hf3c')

* PBEh-3c optimization with default def2-mSVP basis ::

   optimize('pbeh3c')

* HF-3c with non-standard basis ::

   set basis cc-pvdz
   energy('hf3c')

* PBEh-3c with default basis after basis set ::

   set basis cc-pvdz
   energy('pbeh3c/')

If only BSSE/basis set corrections (rather than total energies) are of
interest, the ``gcp`` program can be run independently of the scf
through the python function :py:func:`~qcdb.Molecule.run_gcp`. (This function
is the same |PSIfour|/``gcp`` interface that is called during an scf job.)
This route is much faster than running a HF or DFT energy. ::

   molecule nene {
   Ne
   Ne 1 2.0
   }

   nene.update_geometry()

   >>> E, G = nene.run_gcp('hf3c')

   >>> E, G = nene.run_gcp(func='HF3c', verbose=True)
