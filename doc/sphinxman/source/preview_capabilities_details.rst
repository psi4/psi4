.. _`table:managedmethods`:

.. table:: Capabilities of |PSIfour|, including details of overlapping modules. "✓" runs analytically. "∷" runs derivative with internal finite difference. Single underline "✓̲" or "∷̲" is default module when |globals__qc_module| unspecified. Double underline "✓̳" or "∷̳" is default algorithm type when type selector (e.g., |globals__cc_type|\ ) unspecified.

.. [#d1] Algorithm type selection keyword below. Values to the right: conventional ``CV``, density-fitted ``DF``, and Cholesky-decomposed ``CD``.
.. [#d2] Active orbital values to the right: all-electron ``A`` and frozen-core ``F``.
.. [#d3] Finite difference gradients are only marked explicitly by "∷" for overall (not per-method) lines and when at least one case has analytic gradients implemented, but the capability can be gleaned from the energy availability.
.. [#d10] Also available for DFT references RKS/UKS
.. [#d11] Arbitrary-order *n* through DETCI is inefficient byproduct of CI
.. [#d12] a-CCSD(T) also known as CCSD(aT), Lambda-CCSD(T), and CCSD(T)_L
.. [#d13] DH-DFT only available with DF-MP2
