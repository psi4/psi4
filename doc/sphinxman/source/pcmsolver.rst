|PSIfour| contains code to interface to the PCMSolver library developed
by R. Di Remigio and L. Frediani.
The PCMSolver library requires no additional licence, downloads, or
configuration. The library allows for calculations in solution with the
polarizable continuum model (PCM), a continuum solvation model [Tomasi:2005:2999]_.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Binary**

* .. image:: https://anaconda.org/psi4/pcmsolver/badges/version.svg
     :target: https://anaconda.org/psi4/pcmsolver

* PCMSolver is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS (and Windows, through the Ubuntu shell).

* If using the |PSIfour| binary, PCMSolver has already been installed alongside.

* If using |PSIfour| built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has
  already been installed (instructions at :ref:`sec:quickconda`),
  PCMSolver can be obtained through ``conda install pcmsolver -c psi4``.
  Then enable it as a feature with :makevar:`ENABLE_PCMSolver`,
  hint its location with :makevar:`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`,
  and rebuild |PSIfour| to detect PCMSolver and activate dependent code.

.. * Previous bullet had details. To build |PSIfour| from source and use
..   pcmsolver from conda without thinking, consult.

* To remove a conda installation, ``conda remove pcmsolver``.

**Source**

* .. image:: https://img.shields.io/github/tag/PCMSolver/pcmsolver.svg?maxAge=2592000
     :target: https://github.com/PCMSolver/pcmsolver

* If using |PSIfour| built from source and you want PCMSolver built from
  from source also,
  enable it as a feature with :makevar:`ENABLE_PCMSolver`,
  and let the build system fetch and build it and activate dependent code.

.. index:: PCM; Using PCM

.. _`sec:usingPCM`:

Using the polarizable continuum model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The inclusion of a PCM description of the solvent into your calculation
can be achieved in two ways in |PSIfour|, using either the PCMSolver or ddx package.
PCMSolver is based on a boundary-element discretisation [Cances:1998:309]_,
while ddx is based on a domain decomposition approach
[Cances:2013:054111]_ making it linear scaling.
For more details about ddx see the :ref:`section on ddx <sec:ddx>`.

Using PCMsolver is achieved instead by setting |globals__pcm| ``true`` in your input file.
|Psifour| understands the additional option |pcm__pcm_scf_type| with possible values ``total``
(the default) or ``separate``.
The latter forces the separate handling of nuclear and electronic electrostatic potentials and
polarization charges. It is mainly useful for debugging.

For the calculation of vertical excitation energies with PCM non-equilibrium solvation should be included with: ::

    pcm = {
       Medium {
       Nonequilibrium = True
       }
    }

.. note:: At present PCM can only be used for energy calculations with SCF
          wavefunctions and CC wavefunctions in the PTE approximation [Cammi:2009:164104]_.
          All ERI algorithms (``PK``, ``OUT_OF_CORE``, ``DIRECT``, ``DF``, ``CD``) are supported.

.. note:: linear response calculations (static polarisabilities, TD-SCF) are supported for RHF/UHF if available.

.. warning:: The PCMSolver library **cannot** exploit molecular point group symmetry.

.. warning:: ROHF with PCM is known **not to work**. See `issue #999 on GitHub <https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/999>`_.
             For the adventurous, a fix is available in `pull request #953 on GitHub <https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/953>`_

.. warning:: Analytic gradients and Hessians **are not** available with PCM. Finite differences will be used
             regardless of the ``dertype`` passed to the ``optimize`` function.
             See :srcsample:`pcmsolver/opt-fd` for a sample input.

The PCM model and molecular cavity are specified in a ``pcm`` section that has
to be explicitly typed in by the user. This additional section follows a syntax
that is slightly different from that of |Psifour| and is fully documented
`here <http://pcmsolver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/input.html>`_

A typical input for a Hartree--Fock calculation with PCM would look like the following: ::

    molecule NH3 {
    symmetry c1
    N     -0.0000000001    -0.1040380466      0.0000000000
    H     -0.9015844116     0.4818470201     -1.5615900098
    H     -0.9015844116     0.4818470201      1.5615900098
    H      1.8031688251     0.4818470204      0.0000000000
    units bohr
    no_reorient
    no_com
    }

    set {
      basis STO-3G
      scf_type pk
      pcm true
      pcm_scf_type total
    }

    pcm = {
       Units = Angstrom
       Medium {
       SolverType = IEFPCM
       Solvent = Water
       }

       Cavity {
       RadiiSet = UFF
       Type = GePol
       Scaling = False
       Area = 0.3
       Mode = Implicit
       }
    }
