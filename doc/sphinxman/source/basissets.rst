Basis Sets
==========

Basis sets in |PSIfour| are Gaussian functions (not Slater-type functions or plane waves),
all-electron [no effective core potentials (ECPs)],
and of Gaussian94 format (for ease of export from `EMSL <https://bse.pnl.gov/bse/portal>`_).
Both spherical harmonic (5D/7F) and Cartesian (6D/10F) Gaussian functions are supported,
but their mixtures are not, neither within a basis set (*e.g.*, 6D/7F) nor within a calculation
(*e.g.*, cartesian for the orbital basis and spherical for the fitting basis).
For built-in basis sets, the correct ``spherical``/``cartesian`` value for |globals__puream|
is set internally from the orbital basis.

Built-In Basis Sets
===================

A wide range of orbital basis sets are built into |PSIfour|. These are
summarized in Tables :ref:`Pople <table:basisPopleOrbital>`,
:ref:`Dunning <table:basisDunningOrbital>`, 
:ref:`Dunning (Douglas-Kroll) <table:basisDunningDK>`, 
:ref:`Karlsruhe <table:basisKarlsruhe>`,
:ref:`Jensen <table:basisJensen>`,
and :ref:`Other <table:basisOther>` in Appendix :ref:`apdx:basisTables`.
These tables are arranged so that columns indicate degree of
augmentation by diffuse functions (generally necessary for anions, excited
states, and noncovalent interactions) and DTQ56 indicate the :math:`X\;=\zeta` levels
available.  Several intermediate levels of diffuse space between the customary
non-augmented and augmented versions have been supplied for each basis set,
including heavy-augmented and Truhlar's [Papajak:2011:10]_ calendar
truncations described in Table :ref:`Months Bases <table:basisMonths>`.  Fitting bases 
in Tables :ref:`JKFIT <table:basisDunningJKFIT>`,
:ref:`RI <table:basisDunningMP2FIT>`, and :ref:`DUAL <table:basisDunningDUAL>`
are available for methods incorporating density-fitting or dual-basis
approximations. JKFIT sets are appropriate for fitting :math:`(oo|`\ -type products,
such as encountered in SCF theory and the electrostatics/exchange terms of SAPT.
RI sets are appropriate for fitting :math:`(ov|`\ -type products, such as encountered in
MP2 and most SAPT terms.  Citations for basis sets can be found in their
definition files at :source:`psi4/share/psi4/basis` in the source.  For basis set availability by
element and the default value for keyword |globals__puream|, consult
Appendix :ref:`apdx:basisElement`.

|PSIfour| uses the angular momentum convention below that, consistent
with EMSL, skips the letter ``J``. Note that Gaussian94 convention is
*not* to skip this letter. Another portion of the G94 format, labeling
angular momentum with :samp:`L={l}` syntax is not presently implemented,
though this is coming. ::

Mixing Basis Sets
=================

While the above syntax will suffice for specifying basis sets in most cases,
the user may need to assign basis sets to specific atoms.  To achieve this, a
basis "block" can be used.  We use a snippet from the :srcsample:`mints2` sample
input file, which performs a benzene SCF computation, to demonstrate this
feature. ::

    basis {
       assign DZ
       assign C 3-21G
       assign H1 sto-3g
       assign C1 sto-3g
    }

The first line in this block assigns the DZ basis set to all atoms for the primary/orbital basis. The next
line then assigns 3-21G to all carbon atoms, leaving the hydrogens with the DZ
basis set.  On the third line, the hydrogen atoms which have been specifically
labelled as ``H1`` are given the STO-3G basis set, leaving the unlabelled hydrogen
atoms with the DZ basis set.  Likewise, the fourth line assigns the STO-3G
basis set to just the carbon atoms labelled ``C1``.  This bizarre example was
constructed to demonstrate the syntax, but the flexibility of the basis set
specification is advantageous, for example, when selectively omitting diffuse
functions to make computations more tractable.

In the above example the basis sets have been assigned asymmetrically, reducing
the effective symmetry from :math:`D_{6h}` to :math:`C_{2v}`; |PSIfour| will detect this
automatically and run in the appropriate point group.

Basis blocks can also be named, *e.g.*, :samp:`basis
{optional_basis_name} \\{...\\}` and the basis defined by it later
applied to another molecule. ::

    # sets basis keyword
    basis mybas {
        assign aug-cc-pvtz
        assign f cc-pvtz
    }

    # re-sets basis keyword
    set basis aug-cc-pvtz

    molecule hf {
        H
        F 1 1.0
    }

    molecule h2o {
        O
        H 1 1.0
        H 1 1.0 2 90.0
    }

    # runs HF and H2O with aug-cc-pvtz
    energy('hf', molecule=hf)
    energy('hf', molecule=h2o)

    # re-re-sets basis keyword
    set basis mybas

    # runs HF with cc-pvtz on F and aug-cc-pvtz on H
    energy('hf', molecule=hf)

    # runs H2O with aug-cc-pvtz, effectively
    energy('hf', molecule=h2o)

Finally, we note that the ``basis {...}`` block may also be used
for defining basis sets, as detailed in :ref:`sec:basisUserDefined`.

.. index:: basis set; auxiliary

Calculations requesting density fitting (on by default for many methods)
require auxiliary fitting basis set(s) in addition to the primary
orbital one associated with the |mints__basis| keyword.
When most popular basis sets are being used, including Dunning and
Pople-style, the SCF, DF-MP2, and SAPT codes will chose the appropriate
auxiliary basis set automatically according to :ref:`apdx:basisFamily`,
unless instructed otherwise by setting the auxiliary basis set in the
input.
Should needed elements be missing from the best
auxiliary basis or should the orbital basis be unknown to |PSIfour|,
the auxiliary basis will fall back on `def2 quad-zeta fitting bases
<https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/master/psi4/driver/qcdb/libmintsbasisset.py#L690-L691>`_.
Note that if |mints__basis| is known to be larger than quad-zeta,
|PSIfour| *will not* attempt to fall back on the def2 fitting bases.

The same basis "block" syntax can be
used to specify basis sets other than that used to define orbitals.  For
example, ::

    set df_basis_mp2 cc-pvdz-ri

     or

    df_basis_mp2 {
       assign cc-pVDZ-RI
    }

are both equivalent ways to set the auxiliary basis set for density fitted MP2
computations.  To assign the aug-cc-pVDZ-RI to carbon atoms, the following
command is used::

    df_basis_mp2 {
       assign C aug-cc-pVDZ-RI
    }

.. _`sec:basisDecontracted`:

Decontracted Basis Sets
=======================

Decontraction of the basis set can be useful in certain situations. In
order to decontract a given basis set, simply add "-decon" to the name
of the primary basis set (*e.g.* :srcsample:`decontract`). ::


	set basis cc-pvdz-decon

Obviously this will add significantly to the computational cost of any given calculation, however it can
be useful when checking the basis set dependence of a particular calculated property or in certain situations
where a large basis set is critical. Currently it is recommended that a decontracted basis is always used when performing relativistic calculations using the :ref:`X2C Hamiltonian <sec:relativistic>`.

User-Defined Basis Sets
=======================

.. note:: No recompile of the PSI program is necessary for changes made to
    files in ``$PSIDATADIR``, including those described below.

There are three routes by which a basis set in G94 format can be introduced to |PSIfours| notice.


.. rubric:: (1) Install new basis set file into |PSIfour| basis library.

Copy the basis set definitions for all elements into a blank file. Exclamation points denote comments.
As the first line of the file, add the word ``spherical`` or ``cartesian`` to indicate
whether the basis set will run in (5D/7F) or (6D/10F). ::

Name the file with the name of the basis set and a ``.gbs`` extension,
after applying the following transformations.

* All letters lowercase
* Replace all ``*`` with ``s``
* Replace all ``+`` with ``p``
* Replace all ``(`` ``)`` ``,`` with ``_`` (underscores replace parentheses and commas)

For example, basis 6-31++G** is stored in :source:`psi4/share/psi4/basis/6-31ppgss.gbs`,
and cc-pV(D+d)Z is stored in :source:`psi4/share/psi4/basis/cc-pv_dpd_z.gbs`.
Only one basis set may be specified per file.
Copy the new basis set file into :source:`psi4/share/psi4/basis`.
Request the new basis set in an input file in the usual manner. ::

   set basis new_basis_name


.. rubric:: (2) Use new basis set file in arbitrary location.

Prepare a basis set file exactly as above. Append the directory
containing the basis set file to the environment variable
:envvar:`PSIPATH`.

Request the new basis set in an input file in the usual manner. ::

   set basis new_basis_name

.. rubric:: (3) Include new basis set in input file.

Construct for a basis set a section like the one below that includes
``[basis name]``, |globals__puream| value, and element basis set
specifications. Hash signs denote comments.  This format is exactly like
the stand-alone basis file except for the addition of the basis name in
brackets. ::

Copy the section into a |PSIfour| input file and surround it with the
command ``basis {...}``, as shown below.  Multiple basis sets can be
specified by adding additional sections within the surrounding brackets.
Use ``assign`` statements to actually request the basis set. (See
:srcsample:`mints2` for an example.) ::

   basis {

   # assign basset to all atoms and addl to hydrogens
   assign basset
   assign H addl

   # basis set section like in snippet above goes here
   [basset]
   ...

   # additional basis set sections follow
   [addl]
   ...
   }

.. _`sec:basissets-ecps`:

Inputting effective core potentials (ECPs)
==========================================

For ECP containing basis sets, all of the above mechanisms may still be used to
input the basis set; simply place the ECP definitions (in G94 format) in the
same file or input section as the orbital basis definition.  Because the ECP
appears in the same section as the orbital basis, it will be parsed
automatically and the number of core electrons the ECP represents will be
detected, so no further input is required to use a core potential. See
:ref:`sec:scf-ecps` for more information about using ECPs and the
:source:`Def2-TZVP <psi4/share/psi4/basis/def2-tzvp.gbs>` basis set definition
for an example of their input syntax.
