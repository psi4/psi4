.. table:: Detailed non-orbital-optimized capabilities of the OCC module. "✓" is runs analytically. Single underline "✓̲" is default module when |globals__qc_module| unspecified. Double underline "✓̳" is default algorithm type when type selector (e.g., |globals__cc_type|\ ) unspecified.

.. [#n1] Algorithm type selection keyword below. Values to the right: conventional ``CV``, density-fitted ``DF``, and Cholesky-decomposed ``CD``.
.. [#n2] Active orbital values to the right: all-electron ``A`` and frozen-core ``F``.
.. [#n3] Finite difference gradients are not marked explicitly by "∷", but the capability can be gleaned from the energy availability.
.. [#n10] a-CCSD(T) also known as CCSD(aT), Lambda-CCSD(T), and CCSD(T)_L
