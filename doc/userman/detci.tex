\subsection{Configuration Interaction} \label{detci}

Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to
improve upon Hartree-Fock theory by adding a description of the
correlated motions of electrons.  Simply put, a CI wavefunction
is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted
configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being
determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the
given subspace of determinants.  The simplest standard CI method which
improves upon Hartree-Fock is a CI which adds all singly and doubly
substituted determinants (CISD).  The CISD wavefunction has fallen out
of favor because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive,
meaning that their quality degrades for larger molecules.  MP2 is a less
expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small
molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.
Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive
alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,
but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.

The CI code in \PSIfour\ is described in detail in Reference
\cite{Sherrill:1999:CI}.  For the reasons stated above, the CI code in
\PSIfour\ is not optimized for CISD computations.  Instead, emphasis
has been placed on developing a very efficient program to handle more
general CI wavefunctions which may be helpful in more challenging cases
such as highly strained molecules or bond breaking reactions.  \PSIdetci\
is a fast, determinant-based CI module based upon the string formalism
of Handy \cite{Handy:1980}.  It can solve for restricted active space
configuration interaction (RAS CI) wavefunctions as described by Olsen,
Roos, Jorgensen, and Aa. Jensen \cite{Olsen:1988}.  Excitation-class
selected multi-reference CI wavefunctions, such as second-order CI,
can be formulated as RAS CI's.  A RAS CI selects determinants for the
model space as those which have no more than n holes in the lowest set
of orbitals (called RAS I) and no more than m electrons in the highest
set of orbitals (called RAS III).  An intermediate set of orbitals, if
present (RAS II), has no restrictions placed upon it.  All determinants
satisfying these rules are included in the CI.

\PSIdetci\ is also very efficient at computing full configuration interaction
wavefunctions, and it is used in this capacity in the complete-active-space
self-consistent-field (CASSCF) code.  Use of \PSIdetci\ for CASSCF
wavefunctions is described in the following section of this manual.

As just mentioned, the \PSIfour\ program is designed for challenging 
chemical systems for which simple CISD is not suitable.  Because
CI wavefunctions which go beyond CISD (such as RAS CI) are fairly complex,
typically the \PSIdetci\ program will be used in cases where the 
tradeoffs between computational expense and completeness of the 
model space are nontrivial.  Hence, the user is advised to develop
a good working knowledge of multi-reference and RAS CI methods before
attempting to use the program for a production-level project.  This user's
manual will provide only an elementary introduction to the most
important keywords.  Additional information is available in the complete
list of keywords for \PSIdetci\ provided in the Appendix.

The division of the molecular orbitals into various subspaces such as
RAS spaces, or frozen vs active orbitals, etc, needs to be clear not
only to \PSIdetci\, but also at least to the transformation program
(and in the case of MCSCF, to other programs as well).  Thus, orbital
subspace keywords such as {\tt RAS1}, {\tt RAS2}, {\tt RAS3}, {\tt
frozen\_docc}, {\tt frozen\_uocc}, {\tt active}, etc., should be set
in the global section of input so they may also be read by other modules.

\subsubsection{Basic Keywords}
\begin{description}
\item[WFN = string]\mbox{}\\
Acceptable values for determinant-based CI computations in PSI
are {\tt detci} and, for CASSCF, {\tt detcas}.
\item[REFERENCE = string]\mbox{}\\
Most reference types allowed by PSI are allowed by \PSIdetci\,
except that {\tt uhf} is not supported.
\item[DERTYPE = string]\mbox{}\\
Energies (NONE) and gradients (FIRST) are the allowed options.
\item[CONVERGENCE = integer]\mbox{}\\
Convergence desired on the CI vector.  Convergence is achieved when the
RMS of the error in the CI vector is less than 10**(-n).  The default is 4
for energies and 7 for gradients.
\item[EX\_LVL = integer]\mbox{}\\
Excitation level for excitations into virtual
orbitals (default 2, i.e. CISD).  In a RAS CI, this is the number
of electrons allowed in RAS III.
\item[VAL\_EX\_LVL = integer]\mbox{}\\
In a RAS CI, this is the additional excitation level for allowing
electrons out of RAS I into RAS II.  The maximum number of holes in RAS I
is therefore {\tt EX\_LVL + VAL\_EX\_LVL}.  Defaults to zero.
\item[FROZEN\_DOCC = (integer array)]\mbox{}\\
Core may be frozen by setting {\tt FREEZE\_CORE}.  To
manually select how many orbitals per irrep to freeze, use the
{\tt FROZEN\_DOCC} keyword.
Should be in the global section of input.
The number of lowest energy doubly occupied orbitals in each irreducible
representation from which there will be no excitations.
The Cotton ordering of the irredicible representations is used.
The default is the zero vector.
\item[FROZEN\_UOCC = (integer array)]\mbox{}\\
Should be in the global section of input.
The number of highest energy unoccupied orbitals in each irreducible
representation into which there will be no excitations.
The default is the zero vector.
\item[RAS1 = (integer array)]\mbox{}\\
Should be in the global section of input.
The number of orbitals for each irrep making up the RAS I space,
from which a maximum of {\tt EX\_LVL + VAL\_EX\_LVL} excitations
are allowed.
This does not include frozen core orbitals.  For a normal
CI truncated at an excitation level such as CISD, CISDT, etc., it is
not necessary to specify this or {\tt RAS2} or {\tt RAS3}.
Note: this keyword must be visible to the transformation module
also so that orbitals are ordered correctly (placing it in 
the globals section should be adequate).
\item[RAS2 = (integer array)]\mbox{}\\
Should be in the global section of input.
As above for {\tt RAS1}, but for the RAS II subspace.  
No restrictions are placed on the occupancy of RAS II orbitals.
Typically this will correspond to the conventional idea of
an ``active space'' in multi-reference CI.
\item[RAS3 = (integer array)]\mbox{}\\
Should be in the global section of input.
As above for {\tt RAS3}, but for the RAS III subspace.
A maximum of {\tt EX\_LVL} electrons are allowed in RAS III.
\item[MAXITER = integer]\mbox{}\\
Maximum number of iterations to diagonalize the Hamiltonian.
Defaults to 12.
\item[NUM\_ROOTS = integer]\mbox{}\\
This value gives the number of roots which are to be obtained from
the secular equations.  The default is one.  If more than one root
is required, set {\tt DIAG\_METHOD} to {\tt SEM} (or, for very small cases,
{\tt RSP} or {\tt SEMTEST}).  Note that only roots of the same
irrep as the reference will be computed.  To compute roots of a different
irrep, one can use the {\tt REF\_SYM} keyword (for full CI only).
\item[OPDM = boolean]\mbox{}\\
If {\tt TRUE}, compute the one-particle density matrix for each root.  
By default, it will be written to disk.  Except for 
MCSCF computations (e.g., CASSCF, RASSCF), this will also turn on computation
of dipole moments by default.
\item[TRANSITION\_DENSITY = boolean]\mbox{}\\
If {\tt TRUE}, compute the transition density matrix from the ground
state to each other state obtained in the computation.  By default,
this information will be written to disk.  Transition dipole moments
will be evaluated in \PSIdetci\.  Note: only transition densities
between roots of the same symmetry will be evaluated.  \PSIdetci\ does not
compute states of different irreps within the same computation; to do this,
lower the symmetry of the computation.
% CDS-TODO: Say how to lower the symmetry
\item[DIPMOM = boolean]\mbox{}\\
If {\tt TRUE}, evaluate the dipole moment for each root (using the expectation
value formula; orbital relaxation contributions are neglected).  This is
an alternative to evaluation using the {\tt oeprop} module, which has
more features.
\item[REF\_SYM = integer]\mbox{}\\
This option allows the user to look for CI vectors of a different irrep
than the reference.  This probably only makes sense for Full CI,
and it is not supported for unit vector guesses.
\item[MPN = boolean]\mbox{}\\
If {\tt TRUE}, compute MPn energies up to nth order, where MAXNVECT = n
controls the maximum order energy computed.  For open-shell systems
(REF = ROHF, WFN = ZAPTN), ZAPTn energies are computed.
\end{description}

For larger computations, additional keywords may be required, as
described in the \PSIdetci\ section of the Appendix.

\subsubsection{Arbitrary Order Perturbation Theory}
\PSIfour\ is capable of computing arbitrary order M{\o}ller-Plesset
 perturbation theory (MPn, closed-shell systems) and
Z-averaged perturbation theory (ZAPTn, open-shell systems) energies,
invoked with MPN = TRUE.  The maximum level of perturbation theory
computed is controlled by MAXNVECT.  Higher order energies (2n -
1 and 2n - 2) can be computed at no additional computational cost by
using WIGNER = TRUE.  By default, the n{th} order energy is saved, but
(2n - 1) or (2n - 2) order energies can be saved using SAVE\_MPN2 =
1 or SAVE\_MPN2 = 2, respectively.

For open-shell systems, arbitary order ZAPTn energies can be computed
using WFN = ZAPTN and REF = ROHF.  All other options are the same as
closed-shell MPn.
