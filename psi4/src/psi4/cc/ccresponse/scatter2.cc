    \brief Handle the three tensors needed for Raman Optical Activity Scattering.

    ROA Scattering requires the following polarizability tensors for displaced geometries:
      (1) electric-dipole/electric-dipole;
      (2) electric-dipole/electric-quadrupole; and
      (3) electric-dipole/magnetic-dipole.
