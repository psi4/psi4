Spin-adaptation and general clean-up of CCDENSITY:

X (1) dump
X (2) add_ref
X (3) add_core (nothing to be done here)
X (4) deanti -- still need to make the energy calculation optional and account for all factors of 2
X (5) fold -- Still need to make energy calculation optional.
X (6) sortI
X (7) sortone
X (8) relax_D
X (9) relax_I
X (10) build_Z
X (11) build_A
X (12) build_X
X (13) lag -- Still need proper spin adaptation of each term to minimize contractions
 X (a) Iij
 X (b) Iab
 X (c) Iia
 X (d) Iai
X (14) energy -- Still need to make energy calc optional
(15) twopdm
 X (a) Gijkl
 X (b) Gabcd
 X (c) Gijka
 X (d) Gaibc
 X (e) Gijab
  (f) Giajb -- save until after (T) density code is finished
(16) V_build -- save until later
(17) G_build -- save until later
(18) onepdm -- must first fully spin-adapt Lagrangian

Other tasks:

(1) Make use of swap23 option to dpd_buf4_dump() to save disk space?

(2) Modify get_params.c and get_moinfo.c so that the former is always called first in the CC codes.

X (3) In EOM-CCSD gradient cases, force params.ref=1 (ROHF) to avoid having the spin-adapt the Xi and Zeta codes for now.
