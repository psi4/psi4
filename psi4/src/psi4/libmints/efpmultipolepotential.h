 *  \class MultipolePotentialInt
 *  \brief Computes multipole potential integrals, needed for EFP calculations.
 *  Currently computes potential integrals through octopoles.
 *
 *  Use an IntegralFactory to create this object.
 *  The compute method takes a vector of SharedMatrix objects, which will be populated
 *  in the following order, which matches the order expected by libEFP. The scale factors
 *  are the prefactors that should be included in any contractions involving these integrals
 *  where the numerator comes from permutational symmetry, and the denominator arises from
 *  the coefficients of the power series expansion of the Coulomb operator.
