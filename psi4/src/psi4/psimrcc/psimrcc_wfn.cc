    // Some historical context to understand what you're looking at. PSIMRCC was written around 2006.
    // At the time, it was on the cutting edge of multireference methods. By 2009 and 2010, the main
    // theory-developer decided that Mk-MRCC (which this module exists to compute) wasn't likely to be
    // a viable method, so he stopped development. 2009 was also when the Psi3 -> Psi4 transition started.
    // Accordingly, some aspects of the original module design don't make much sense from the perspective
    // of Psi4, and they were never modernized thoroughly.
    // What you have now is a clumsy attempt to modernize the module from one of the developers brave(?)/foolish
    // enough to hazard dealing with this code. Modernizing here means "uses Wavefunction."
    // Let this serve as a warning against contributing a new module to Psi. New methods should be
    // plugins so you don't create a maintainability problem when you're no longer working on the code.
    // Look on this module, ye mighty, and despair.
