/// system. This can be used to figure out why a preceeding system call (eg. lseek) has failed. Callers should save the
/// value of errno into a local variable **immediately** after the call that should be checked returns, because there
/// are a lot of things in C++ that can potentially fail and overwrite the global errno with a new error code.
/// @param errno_in : the error code from the OS
/// @return Human-readable error message from the OS. May or may not be in English.
