/// @brief Composes an error message explaining that an IO system call has failed, with the error message from the OS
/// (based on errno), some context from the caller of this function and the unit number. Callers should save the
/// value of errno into a local variable **immediately** after the IO call returns, as there are a lot of things in C++
/// that can potentially fail and overwrite the global errno with a new error code.
/// @param beginning : Beginning of the error message. Should not end with a newline.
/// @param context : Some information about the context of the IO call that has failed. Should not end with a newline.
/// @param unit : Unit number that the IO failed on
/// @param errno_in : The value of errno after the failed IO call
/// @return String explaining the error. Ends with a newline.
