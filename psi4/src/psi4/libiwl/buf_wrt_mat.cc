** iwl_buf_wrt_mat()
**
** Write to an Integrals With Labels formatted buffer. The buffer
** must have been initialized with iwl_buf_init().  Don't forget to
** call iwl_buf_flush() when finished with all writes to the buffer
** to ensure that all contents are written to disk.
**
** This version takes as input a matrix, as might be handy for a
** matrix formulation of an integral transformation.  It assumes that
** all rs are available for a given pq. r and s are allowed to range
** from rfirst/sfirst to rlast/slast (with s<=r), and this maps to a
** matrix addressing of 0 to (rlast-rfirst) and 0 to (slast-sfirst).
**
** This routine is also compatible with a reordering of the orbitals
** before output.  We assume that p and q are already reordered,
** but r and s are not (yet).  The reordered address of an orbital
** is computed according to rtr = reorder[r] - reorder_offset.
**
** I have further modified the routine to spit out integrals whose
** reordered indices are canonical ij >= kl.  The routine does not
** care whether ptr >= qtr, but it insists that the transformed pq
** and kl indices (called ij and kl in the routine) satisfy ij >= kl.
