    Constrained Unrestricted Hartree-Fock

    Reference: T. Tsuchimochi and G.E. Scuseria, J. Chem. Phys. 133,
               141102 (2010)

    This is an alternative formulation of ROHF as a contrained UHF. A
    Lagrangian constraint is placed on the usual UHF procedure to remove
    the spin contamination. The result is an ROHF energy and semicanonical
    ROHF orbitals. The need to pick coupling coefficients is removed.
    Koopmans' theorem is valid for CUHF orbital energes.

    It is claimed that CUHF does not suffer from the convergence problems
    of certain ROHF implementations (not sure how PSI's ROHF code does).
    CUHF retains the UHF-like trait that Ca != Cb. Also, the converged CUHF
    wavefunction yields the correct value for <S^2>, however, this is only
    true at convergence. It is possible that this increased flexibility
    improves convergence.

    -- EGH, August 15th, 2011

    TODO:

    Probably can't handle NSO != NMO right now, should either fix this code
    or the transform functions from Matrix.

    Using the UHF form for the Lagrangian, this is probably correct, but
    should be checked.
