** 1/2 (Ipq + Iqp).  This matrix is later written to disk in dump()
** for subsequent backtransformation.  Note that some of the
** components of the Lagrangian computed into the IIJ, Iij, IIA, and
** Iia matrices remain non-symmetric (e.g., IIJ neq IJI).  I re-used
** my sortone.c code here, so don't let some of the variable names
