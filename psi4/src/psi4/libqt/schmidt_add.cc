** SCHMIDT_ADD(): Assume A is a orthogonal matrix.  This function Gram-Schmidt
** orthogonalizes a new vector v and adds it to matrix A.  A must contain
** a free row pointer for a new row.  Don't add orthogonalized v' if
** norm(v') < NORM_TOL.
**
** David Sherrill, Feb 1994
**
** \param A    = matrix to add new vector to
** \param rows = current number of rows in A
**               (A must have ptr for 'rows+1' row.)
** \param cols = columns in A
** \parm v     = vector to add to A after it has been made orthogonal
**               to rest of A
**
** Returns: 1 if a vector is added to A, 0 otherwise
