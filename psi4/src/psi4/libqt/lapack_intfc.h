** 
** This function computes the eigenvalues and the left and right
** right eigenvectors of a real, nonsymmetric matrix A.  For 
** symmetric matrices, refer to C_DSYEV().
**
** \param n = The order of the matrix A.  n >= 0.
**
** \param a =  The n-by-n matrix A.  As with all other lapack
** routines, must be allocated by contiguous memory (i.e., block_matrix()).
**
** \param lda = The leading dimension of matrix A.  lda >= max(1,n).
**
** \param wr = array of length n containing the real parts of 
** computed eigenvalues.
**
** \param wi = array of length n containing the imaginary parts of 
** computed eigenvalues.
**
** \param vl = matrix of dimensions ldvl*n.  The columns store
** the left eigenvectors u(j).  If the j-th eigenvalues is real, then
** u(j) = vl(:,j), the j-th column of vl.  If the j-th and (j+1)-st 
** eigenvalues form a complex conjugate pair, then u(j) = vl(:,j) +
** i*vl(:,j+1) and u(j+1) = vl(:,j) - i*vl(:,j+1).  Note: this is
** the Fortran documentation, may need to change cols <-> rows.
**
** \param ldvl = The leading dimension of matrix vl.
**
** \param vr = matrix of dimensions ldvr*n.  The columns store
** the right eigenvectors v(j).  If the j-th eigenvalues is real, then
** v(j) = vr(:,j), the j-th column of vr.  If the j-th and (j+1)-st
** eigenvalues form a complex conjugate pair, then v(j) = vr(:,j) +
** i*vr(:,j+1) and v(j+1) = vr(:,j) - i*vr(:,j+1).  Note: this is
** the Fortran documentation, may need to change cols <-> rows.
**
** \param ldvr = The leading dimension of matrix vr.
**
** \param work =  Array for scratch computations, of dimension
** lwork.  On successful exit, work[0] returns the optimal value of lwork.
**
** \param lwork = The dimension of the array work.  lwork >= max(1,3*n),
** and if eigenvectors are required (default for this wrapper at present)
** then actually lwork >= 4*n.  For good performance, lwork must generally
** be larger.  If lwork = -1, then a workspace query is assumed.  The 
** routine only calculates the optimal size of the work array, returns
** this value ans the first entry of the work array, and no error
** message related to lword is issued by xerbla.
**
** \param info = On output (returned by C_DGEEV), a status flag.
** info = 0 for successful exit, if info = -i, the ith argument had
** an illegal value.  If info = i, the QR algorithm failed to
** compute all the eigenvalues, and no eigenvectors have been computed.
** Elements i+1:n of wr and wi contain eigenvalues which have converged.
