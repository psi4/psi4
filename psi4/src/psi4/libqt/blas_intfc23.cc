 *           On entry, UPLO specifies whether the upper or lower
 *           triangular part of the band matrix A is being supplied as

/**
 *  Purpose
 *  =======
 *
 *  DTRSV  solves one of the systems of equations
 *
 *     A*x = b,   or   A'*x = b,
 *
 *  where b and x are n element vectors and A is an n by n unit, or
 *  non-unit, upper or lower triangular matrix.
 *
 *  No test for singularity or near-singularity is included in this
 *  routine. Such tests must be performed before calling this routine.
 *
 *  Arguments
 *  ==========

 *           On entry, UPLO specifies whether the matrix is an upper or
 *           lower triangular matrix as follows:
 *
 *              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   A is an upper triangular matrix.
 *
 *              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   A is a lower triangular matrix.
 *
 *           Unchanged on exit.
 *
