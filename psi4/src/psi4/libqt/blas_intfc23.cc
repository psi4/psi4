/**
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DTRSV  solves one of the systems of equations
*
*     A*x = b,   or   A'*x = b,
*
*  where b and x are n element vectors and A is an n by n unit, or
*  non-unit, upper or lower triangular matrix.
*
*  No test for singularity or near-singularity is included in this
*  routine. Such tests must be performed before calling this routine.
*
*  Arguments
*  ==========
*
*  UPLO   - CHARACTER*1.
*           On entry, UPLO specifies whether the matrix is an upper or
*           lower triangular matrix as follows:
*
*              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   A is an upper triangular matrix.
*
*              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   A is a lower triangular matrix.
*
*           Unchanged on exit.
*
*  TRANS  - CHARACTER*1.
*           On entry, TRANS specifies the equations to be solved as
*           follows:
*
*              TRANS = 'N' or 'n'   A*x = b.
*
*              TRANS = 'T' or 't'   A'*x = b.
*
*              TRANS = 'C' or 'c'   A'*x = b.
*
*           Unchanged on exit.
*
*  DIAG   - CHARACTER*1.
*           On entry, DIAG specifies whether or not A is unit
*           triangular as follows:
*
*              DIAG = 'U' or 'u'   A is assumed to be unit triangular.
*
*              DIAG = 'N' or 'n'   A is not assumed to be unit
*                                  triangular.
*
*           Unchanged on exit.
*
*  N      - INTEGER.
*           On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A.
*           N must be at least zero.
*           Unchanged on exit.
*
*  A      - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION ( LDA, n ).
*           Before entry with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the leading n by n
*           upper triangular part of the array A must contain the upper
*           triangular matrix and the strictly lower triangular part of
*           A is not referenced.
*           Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the leading n by n
*           lower triangular part of the array A must contain the lower
*           triangular matrix and the strictly upper triangular part of
*           A is not referenced.
*           Note that when  DIAG = 'U' or 'u', the diagonal elements of
*           A are not referenced either, but are assumed to be unity.
*           Unchanged on exit.
*
*  LDA    - INTEGER.
*           On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
*           in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least
*           max( 1, n ).
*           Unchanged on exit.
*
*  X      - DOUBLE PRECISION array of dimension at least
*           ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ).
*           Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n
*           element right-hand side vector b. On exit, X is overwritten
*           with the solution vector x.
*
*  INCX   - INTEGER.
*           On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of
*           X. INCX must not be zero.
*           Unchanged on exit.
*
