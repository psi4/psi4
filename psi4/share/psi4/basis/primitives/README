Brief Instructions:

Automation is really only for the Dunning basis sets. For others, use emsl_manipulate.pl directly.

[1]   Update any of the primitives (basis-, corevalence-, tight-, diffuse-, hold-, molpro-,
      partial-, etc.) as needed. These come directly from EMSL.

[2]   Make the necessary hand edits to hold- files. Detailed instructions for first generation are 
      found in NOTES. Changes should only be necessary if their dependent basis sets from EMSL changed.

[3]   Run make_dunning.pl to generate the basis sets proper. dual adzp will be carried along but
      these need to be edited by hand to actually make changes.

[4]   Run `dunning_prepend_and_checknew.pl` to add spherical to the top of the file and show if the basis
      is any different from its current form (presently set to one directories up- change as needed).
      Blue is new, yellow is changed, red is deleted.

      Can run diff_gbs.py directly on one (`./diff_gbs.py probe.gbs`) or two files (`./diff_gbs.py probe.gbs ref.gbs`)

[5]   Look at basisdunningfiles.txt and transfer into the main basis directory any that have changed.

[6]   Delete basis sets here (keep primitives) via `./clean.sh`.
