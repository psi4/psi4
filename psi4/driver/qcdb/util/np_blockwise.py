    Return a 2N-D view of the given N-D array, rearranged so each ND block (tile)
    of the original array is indexed by its block address using the first N
    indexes of the output array.

    Note: This function is nearly identical to ``skimage.util.view_as_blocks()``, except:
          - "imperfect" block shapes are permitted (via require_aligned_blocks=False)
          - only contiguous arrays are accepted.  (This function will NOT silently copy your array.)
            As a result, the return value is *always* a view of the input.

    Args:
        a: The ND array
        blockshape: The tile shape

        aslist: If True, return all blocks as a list of ND blocks
                instead of a 2D array indexed by ND block coordinate.
        require_aligned_blocks: If True, check to make sure no data is "left over"
                                in each row/column/etc. of the output view.
                                That is, the blockshape must divide evenly into the full array shape.
                                If False, "leftover" items that cannot be made into complete blocks
                                will be discarded from the output view.

     [ 6  7  8  9 10]
