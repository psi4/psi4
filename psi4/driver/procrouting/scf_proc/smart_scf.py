class smart_solver():
    #TODO: Change to staging procedure
    """Purpose: enable easy extension of "smart" SCF solving capabilities.
    This class is an attribute of a wfn object ... a wfn object is also
            an attribute of this class for easy data transfer.

    Methods:
        __init__: creates objects to hold energy and density history
        smart_iter: one stop method call placed in .iterations() function
                makes decisions about convergence tools

        trailing_conv: is the SCF stuck in trailing convergence?
                if so, turn on SOSCF and some damping.

        init_damp: is the guess case SAD, GWH, or CORE? if so, damp the 
                initial SCF iterations to remove wild energy changes.
                Currently set at 70%, a la ORCA, could fine tune a bit.

    Attributes:
        E_history: simple list of SCF energies in the current set of iterations.
        Drms_history: simple list of Drms values in the current set of iterations.

    Notes:

        The goal with having this class exist at all is to nicely contain
                tools for scf convergence in one spot. Extensibility
                could go something like this:

                    1. add a method to smart_solver class:
                        def great_convergence(self):
                            great convergence tricks

                    2. simply add a call in smart_iter to incorporate it into
                            smart_scf.

                    3. You're done!
