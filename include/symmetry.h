  Point groups at this moment are limited to D2h and sumbgroups
  Therefore the number of symmetry elements is at most 8. Each
  symmetry operation corresponds to a bit of a byte word. The
  correspondence is hardwired via defines "GFLAG" where G is
  the operation symbol.

  To describe nuclear stabilizers or subgroups in general I use
  a byte in which bits corresponding to the symmetry operations
  that constitute the group are set. The result is that each
  operation's contribution to the byte equals "GCODE".
