** rotate_vecs(): Rotate a set of vectors around an arbitrary axis
**
** \brief Rotate a set of vectors around an arbitrary axis
** Vectors are rows of input matrix
**
** \param  w     double *  : axis to rotate around (wx, wy, wz) - gets normalized here
** \param  phi   double    : magnitude of rotation
** \param  v   double ** : points to rotate - column dim is 3; overwritten on exit
** \param  num_v  int       :
**
** Returns: none
