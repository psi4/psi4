** MAT_IN(): Function to read in a matrix.  Simple version for now.
**
** Parameters:
**    \param fp         =  file pointer to input stream
**    \param array      =  matrix to hold data
**    \param width      =  number of columns to read
**    \param max_length =  maximum number of rows to read
**    \param stat       =  pointer to int to hold status flag 
**                         (0=read ok, 1=error)
**
** Returns: 
**    number of rows read
**    Also modifies stat to = error code (0 = ok, 1 = error)
