** get_writer_file_prefix()
**
** For archival files such as the Hessian, Molden files, etc., we want
** to write a file in the current working directory with a name like
** benzene.molden, benzene.hess, etc.  This function returns the basename
** of such files.  The basename is determined as follows: If the option
** "WRITER_FILE_LABEL" exists, we will use that.  It could be user-specified, 
** or created by a python driver doing a complex task (e.g., 
** S22-1-dimer-mp2-ccpvdz).  If the label option is blank (default), 
** then we will just make up a prefix using the basename of the output
** file along with the active molecule name (e.g., test.h2o).
**
** C. David Sherrill and Lori Burns
**
** Returns: C++ standard string of the filename prefix
