/** \brief Very basic class that stores the properties of an MPI task
 *
 *  For our purposes you need to come up with some labeling scheme for
 *  your tasks.  If it is easier for you to label your tasks with integers
 *  than this object would be of type MPITask<int>, if you want to use
 *  strings, than it is of type MPITask<string>, etc.  i.e.:
 *
 *  \param[in] T The type of your label
 *
 *  Optionally, you many also specify the priority of your tasks.
 *  By default all tasks are assumed to possess the same priority.
 *  Higher numbers mean it needs to be scheduled first, i.e. it is a more
 *  complex task, with complexity being measured relative to other tasks
 *  in your task pool.  It's also worth noting, that currently I only assume
 *  that a task of priority 10 is more complicated than a task of priority 1,
 *  not that it is 10x harder.
 *
 *  If you need to, you may use negative priorities
 *  for tasks that are of an unknown complexity.  For negative priorities
 *  the magnitude is irrelevant, i.e. I do not assume a task of priority -1
 *  is more or less complex than one of priority -2, I simply assume they
 *  both may have a random complexity.  Based on the overall complexity of
 *  your set of tasks an appropriate scheduler will be chosen.
