/** \brief The interface to the new Psi4 ASCII outfile writer
 *
 * First thing to note is that copying of this class is disallowed and is
 * enforced by making the assignment operator and copy constructor private.
 * This is because the C++ standard does not allow copying of streams, which
 * is surprising to most people when they first hear it, but in the long run
 * makes a lot of sense.  Streams are, as the name suggests, the mechanism
 * through which data flows; they are not the data itself.  Most likely when
 * someone wants to copy a stream, they want to copy the data itself (this is
 * what we do in the copy constructor of PsiStreamBase) and not the mechanism
 * by which the data flows.  In order to avoid this confusion the C++ standard
 * makes copying prohibited.  Now in reality we could allow copying because we
 * are dealing with pointers and not the actual objects; copying of a pointer
 * is of course not prohibited, but I'll stick to the example laid forth by
 * the C++ standard.
 *
 * The other thing to note is that this class keeps the file open until it
 * goes out of scope or you tell it to close.  With the exception of Psi4's main
 * output file, this means you probably want to print what you gotta' print and
 * then close it, don't keep it open any longer then you have to.

       *  opens the file in that mode instead.  The mechanism of the
