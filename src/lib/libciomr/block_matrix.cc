** block_matrix(): Allocate a 2D array of doubles using contiguous memory
**
** Allocates a contiguous block of memory for an array of
** doubles, allocates an array of pointers to the beginning of each row and
** returns the pointer to the first row pointer.  This allows transparent
** 2d-array style access, but keeps memory together such that the matrix
** could be used in conjunction with FORTRAN matrix routines.
**
** Allocates memory for an n x m matrix and returns a pointer to the
** first row.
**
** \param n = number of rows (unsigned long to allow large matrices)
** \param m = number of columns (unsigned long to allow large matrices)
** \param memlock = optional bool indicating whether to lock memory
**   into physical RAM or not, and available only where _POSIX_MEMLOCK
**   is defined. Defaults to false if not specified.
**
** Returns: double star pointer to newly allocated matrix
**
** T. Daniel Crawford
** Sometime in 1994

** Based on init_matrix() from libciomr
