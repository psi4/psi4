/** \brief The purpose of this class is to form an abstract base class for
 *         the various binary files used in Psi.
 *
 *  When each binary file is readed and wroted certain data is expected to
 *  be in that binary file.  As of right now every time someone wants to use
 *  that file they need to take care to ensure that all of the data is inside
 *  the file for other parts of the program.  Consequentially, the act of
 *  opening a file means large chunks of code are being dumped all over the
 *  place.  In an ideal C++ world those large chunks of code would be
 *  mitigated to their own classes, so that if the structure of the file
 *  changes, it only changes in one place: the instance of this class.
 *
 *  This binary file class also has a nifty feature in that it is designed
 *  to save code.  Most binary files in Psi4 have a series of "Table of
 *  Contents" (ToC) entries associated with basic variables.  I have made it
 *  so that these entries will be read'n and written for you if you tell
 *  me about them at file creation time.  See the MOFile class for an
 *  example, but basically you need to use the AddVariable and Fill
 *  functions.  Call AddVariable in your constructor, and then Fill, in
 *  whatever fxn you use to add the actual values to your file.
