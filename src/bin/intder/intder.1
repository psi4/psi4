.SH INTRODUCTION
.LP
.B INTDER
is a connected set of programs for performing general curvilinear
transformations and associated tasks often encountered in the calculation
of anharmonic molecular force fields.  The capabilites of 
.B INTDER
include:
.IP "(1)"
Force field transformations between Cartesian and general internal
coordinate spaces up to fourth order, including nonstationary reference
structures.  Both forward and reverse transformations are possible; hence,
by using intermediate Cartesian coordinates, force fields can be
transferred among different representations in the internal space.
.LP
.IP "(2)"
Harmonic vibrational frequency and infrared intensity analyses, both in
Cartesian and internal coordinate space.
.LP
.IP "(3)"
Scaled quantum mechanical (SQM) force field analyses, including efficient
nonlinear optimization of scale factors.
.LP
.IP "(4)"
Transformation of dipole-moment derivatives between Cartesian and internal
coordinates.
.LP
.IP "(5)"
Generation of displaced geometries along general internal coordinates for
use in finite-difference computations of molecular force fields.
.LP
.IP "(6)"
Direct Cartesian projection of any external (translation/rotation) variable
dependence out of Cartesian anharmonic force fields.

The original program 
.B INTDER
was developed to run with the 
.I ab initio
molecular orbital package
.B PSI
(PSITECH Inc., Watkinsville, Georgia).  Accordingly, it used several
conventions for the naming and handling of files.  Such conventions are essentially retained in 
.B INTDER95,
although new output and scratch files have been added.  Vide infra for a
summary of the files used by 
.B INTDER95.
It is well imagined that many of these scratch files and PSI files
are going to be modified or eliminated to coincide with PSI 3.2

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
The input for this program is read from the file
.pN INPUT .
The
.B intder
program reads the definition of internal coordinates from the
.B INTCO
section of the input, and then
searches through the default keyword path (first
.B INTDER
and then
.BR DEFAULT
). 
The following keywords are valid:


.IP "\fBDERLVL =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This gives the highest order of derivative to be transformed.  It can have
a value from 1 to 4.  The default is 2.

.IP "\fBDISP =\fP \fIdisplacement_vector\fP"
If the DISP vector is present, this indicates that INTDER95
is to obtain molecular geometries that are distorted in a prescribed
way from the reference geometry.  Note that the distortions are exact
curvilinear distortions.  Each element of this vector is a 
vector consisting of internal coordinate indices and displacement
values.  For example, if you desire two displacements, the
first being a displacement of internal coordinate 1 by 0.01 angstroms,
the second being a combination
of displacements, e.g. coordinate 1 displaced by 0.01 angstroms and
coordinate 2 by 0.05 angstroms, the
.B DISP
vector would be:
.DS
   disp = (
     (1 0.01)
     (1 0.01 2 0.05)
     )
.DE

If the 
MASSES array is present, then the Eckart conditions are invoked for the
displacements.  This is important in the evaluation of infrared
intensities by finite differences of dipole moments.  
Otherwise, unit masses are used in the calculation.
If the HIGH_ORDER
option is set, then the new Cartesian geometry is converged upon
using first and second-order information (see 
HIGH_ORDER).

.IP "\fBHIGH_ORDER = \fP \fIboolean\fP"
If true, then first- and second-order information, i.e. the
analytic B(p)(ij) matrices, are used to accelerate convergence to 
new Cartesian geometries in displacement calculations.

.IP "\fBPRINT_LVL =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This is a four digit number which will be explained below.  The default is
3000.

.IP "\fBDUMMY_ATOMS =\fP \fIreal_array\fP"
This array specifies the Cartesian coordinates of dummy atoms for LIN1
linear bending coordinates.  Each dummy atom position is actually treated
as a fixed direction vector perpendicular to the plane of bending.  The
\fIreal_array\fP is a vector of coordinates of each dummy atom.  Each
element of this vector is another vector in the form \fB(\fP\fIx\fP \fIy\fP
\fIz\fP\fB)\fP.  The numbering for the dummy atoms begins at NA+1 (NA =
number of atoms).  Note that the new LIN1 definition was referred to as
LIN2 in the old intder program. Also note that this keyword is not invalid
since we are getting our information from optking/input

.IP "\fBFREQ_ANAL =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This option specifies what type of harmonic frequency analysis to perform. 
The options
are:
.  iV            "= NONE"    "no frequency analysis performed"
.  iV            "= INT_CO"  "perform a frequency analysis in internal coordinates"
.  iV            "= CART_CO" "perform a frequency analysis in Cartesian"
.    __                   "coordinates"
.  iV            "= BOTH"    "do frequency analysis in both internal and Cartesian coordinates"
.  iV            "= INT_CO_R"  "the same as = INT_CO except that the force constants"
.    __                   "are input from the"
.    __                   "Q_F_CONSTS vector"
.  iV            "= RXN_PATH"  "Perform a frequency analysis in a reduced-dimension internal coordinate space with one constrained reaction variable specified by the RXN_COORD keyword"
.  iV            "= SQMFC"   "Perform a scaled quantum mechanical force constant calculation (SQMFC).  A separate SQMFC input section is required (see below)."
.iL
The default is NONE.

.IP "\fB SKIP_T =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If true, no derivatives are transformed. This is to make the FREQ_ANAL keyword 
less confusing.

.IP "\fBIRINT_T =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If = NO, then no IR intensities are computed.  If = YES then internal 
coordinate dipole moment derivatives are read in from
.pN FILE18 
and IR intensities are computed.  Setting IRINT_T = DO_R does the same as
DO except that internal coordinate dipole moment derivatives are read
from the INT_DIPDER vector. The default is NONE.
Will eventually be changed so that this works automatically.

.IP "\fBINT_DIPDER =\fP \fIreal_matrix\fP"
This matrix must be present if IRINT_T = DO_R.
It is made up of NSX vectors of length 3 and contains 
internal (symmetry) coordinate dipole moment derivatives (x, y, z) in units of
Debye/Angstrom or Debye/radian.
NSX is as defined for Q_F_CONSTS.

.IP "\fBTRANS_DIPDER =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If true then dipole moment derivatives are transformed.
Masses are read in later so that the
transformation is performed according to the
Eckart conditions.
The dipole derivatives are read from
.pN FILE17
or
.pN FILE18
(see below for a description of
the input required).
For \fBTRANS_DIPDER =\fP true, set DERLVL = 1 and TRANS_TYPE = C_TO_I or I_TO_C.
(TRANS_DIPDER = TRUE assigns TRANS_1DER = TRUE).
It is not possible to transform dipole moment
derivatives at the same time as energy derivatives.
If TRANS_DIPDER = TRUE, FREQ_ANAL and IRINT_T should be NONE.
The default is FALSE.

.IP "\fBMASS_TRANS =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If true, the masses specified by the MASSES array are used for derivative
transformations, including Cartesian projections.  Otherwise, unit masses
are used.

.IP "\fBMULTI =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This option specifies the number of geometries to read from
.pN FILE11 .
If 
.B MULTI 
= 0, the last geometry in 
.pN FILE11
is used.  If 
.B MULTI 
= n, then n geometries are read from
.pN FILE11
from the top to bottom.  The default is 0.  (Supported by new-style
input only).
I don't know why this would be necessary?

.IP "\fBNUMTEST =\fP \fIstring\fP"
Numerical testing of derivatives of the internal coodinates
with respect to the Cartesian coordinates is useful for
debugging new types of coordinates added to the program.
.  iV            "= \0NONE"  "no test"
.  iV            "= \0SECOND"  "numerically test and check the analytic"
.    __                   "B(P)(I,J) and C(P)(M,N) matrices"
.  iV            "= \0THIRD"  "numerically test and check the analytic"
.    __                   "B(P)(I,J,K) and C(P)(L,M,N) matrices"
.  iV            "= ORTHOG"   "Analyze the generalized overlap matrix"
.    __                   "(B u B(T)) to gauge the linear dependence of the"
.    __                   "internal coordinates used to construct the first-order B matrix."
.iL
The default is NONE. 

.IP "\fINTCO_INCLUDE =\fP \fboolean array\fP"
A boolean array that should be less than or equal to the number of internal coordinates
This keyword must be present if you are numerically testing internal coordinates.
Use a "0" in the array to skip that specific intco, and use a "1" to
test that intco. 
For example, if you have four internal coordinates and you wish to only test the second
you would use INTCO_INCLUDE = (0 1 0 0)

.IP "\fBQ_F_CONSTS =\fP \fIreal_matrix\fP"
This matrix must be present if FREQ_ANAL = NONE_R.
Its dimension is NSX by NSX, where NSX = the number of symmetrized
internal coordinates, or the number of simple internal coordinates if
no symmetrized internal coordinates are given.
Confused here, NONE_R is not given as a possible keyword of FREQ_ANAL

.IP "\fBPED = \fP \fIboolean\fP"
If true, assign normal modes according to the simplified 
potential energy distribution
(PED) method.  Default is false; normal modes are now assigned according
to the diagonal elements of the total energy distribution (TED).

.IP "\fBRXN_COORD = \fP \fIinteger\fP"
If 
.B FREQ_ANAL
= RXN_PATH, then the 
.B RXN_COORD
keyword specifies the number of the internal coordinate which is
constrained as the reaction variable.  There is no default.

.IP "\fBSTOP =\fP \fIstring\fP"
If 
STOP = B_AND_C,
stop after forming the B(P)(I,J) and C(P)(Q,R) matrices (stored on 
FILE91, FILE92, and FILE96),
and the B(P)(I,J,K),
and C(P)(Q,R,S) matrices (stored on FILE93, FILE94, and FILE97), as governed by 
DERLVL and TRANS_1DER.
No auxiliary files are required (unless READ_GEOM = TRUE).
If 
STOP = B, stop after forming the B(eta)(I1,I2,I3,...,In) matrices for 
Cartesian projection.  If 
STOP = C, stop after forming the explicit Cartesian projection
matrices.  The default is 0.

.IP "\fBTRANS_1DER =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If true, then assume non-zero first derivatives are to be transformed.  
The default is FALSE.
not included yet

.IP "\fBTRANS_TYPE =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This specifies what type of transformation to perform.  If equal to
C_TO_I, Cartesian derivatives are transformed to internal coordinate
derivatives.  If equal to I_TO_C, then internal coordinate derivatives are
transformed to Cartesian derivatives.  I_TO_C_R is the same as I_TO_C 
except the internal coordinate derivatives are read from the file
.pN IDER
which is produced by the
.B intdif
program.  If equal to PROJECT, then Cartesian force constants are projected
onto the internal space of the molecular system.  Direct projection is
currently not available for linear molecules.  However, such analyses can be
performed indirectly by neglecting Cartesian gradients (TRANS_1DER = FALSE),
transforming the force field into any valid, complete set of internal
coordinates (TRANS_TYPE = C_TO_I), and finally back-transforming the results
once again to the Cartesian space (TRANS_TYPE = I_TO_C or I_TO_C_R).
The default is C_TO_I.
not included. Think this is an intdif function.

.IP "\fBINVARIANCE =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Test the Cartesian force field for invariance with respect to external
variables (translations/rotations).  The default is 
.B FALSE.

.SH INPUT FOR SQM FORCE FIELD ANALYSES (not yet begun)
.LP
An SQM force field analysis is performed if FREQ_ANAL=SQMFC or
SQMFC_NO_T.   
If an SQM analysis is desired, a separate input section is required. 
In the input file, 
begin a new input section with the label sqmfc.  This input
section may be contained outside or inside the intder section.
The following options are valid.

.IP "\fBFUNDAMENTALS =\fP \fIreal_array"
This keyword specifies the experimental frequencies to be used in the fit.
Although the keyword is named FUNDAMENTALS, note that it is also
possible to fit to experimental harmonic frequencies, if available.
FUNDAMENTALS is a vector of arrays.  Each vector specifies the 
experimental frequencies for a given isotopomer, along with the
corresponding normal mode and an optional weight factor.  
For example, suppose that we wish to perform an SQMFC analysis 
on HNCO and DNCO.  Suppose further that we have experimental
frequencies for all six modes of HNCO, but for only three modes
of DNCO.  The appropriate input might be

.DS
      fundamentals = (
          ((1   568.3)
           (2   635.1)
           (3   826.8)
           (4  1336.3)
           (5  2313.6)
           (6  3724.1 1.0))
          ((4  1323.1)
           (5  2288.4)
           (6  2738.6))
         )
.DE

The frequency 3724.1 is given a weight factor of 1.0, which will
override any weights assigned by the WEIGHT keyword (
.I vide infra
).

For each isotopomer, the fundamentals are to be numbered from lowest
wavenumber to highest wavenumber, disregarding symmetry species but
.I accounting for missing assignments.
In essence, after the eigenvalues of the GF matrix have been determined and
ordered in a given step of the optimization, the specified numbering
indicates the correspondence of these eigenvalues to the experimental
fundamental frequencies involved in the SQMFC procedure.

.IP "\fBISOTOPES =\fP \fIreal_array\fP or \fIcharacter_array\fP" 
Masses are input following this keyword for each of the isotopes 
to be considered in the SQMFC procedure.  The format is the same
as for the MASSES keyword, except that ISOTOPES is a vector
of mass vectors.   For example, the ISOTOPES vector for HNCO
might be

.DS
   isotopes = ((O C N H))
.DE

whereas if the deuterated isotopomer was also to be considered,
the appropriate input would be 

.DS
   isotopes = (
      (O C N H)
      (O C N D)
     )
.DE

.IP "\fBOPT_SF = \fP \fIboolean\fP"
This keyword tells the program whether to optimize the scale factors in the 
SQMFC analysis (true) or to use fixed scale factors (false).

.IP "\fBSCALE_FACTORS = \fP \fIreal and int array\fP"
This keyword allows the input of the scale factors for the SQMFC procedure
(fixed or initial guesses, depending on the value of OPT_SF).
The input consists of one array for each scale factor.  Each array 
contains a scale factor (real) followed by the internal coordinates to
which the scale factor applies (integers).  The following example
shows a scale factor of 0.815 for internal coordinates 1 and 2,
and a scale factor of 0.898 for internal coordinate 3:
.DS

   scale_factors = (
      (0.815 1 2)
      (0.898 3)
     )
.DE

.IP "\fBSF_HESS = \fP \fIstring\fP"
This keyword tells the program how to determine the scale factor Hessian
for an optimization.
The options are:
.  iV            "= GUESS"    "Allow the program to make initial guesses for"
.    __                      "the diagonal elements of the scale factor Hessian."
.  iV            "= INPUT"    "Input the diagonal elements of the inverse of the scale factor Hessian with the SF_HESS_DIAG option."
.  iV            "= ANAL "     "Compute the scale factor Hessian analytically at each step."
.  iV            "= NUM_FD"   "Compute the scale factor Hessian numerically at each step by a finite-difference procedure."
.  iV            "= LLS  "      "Obtain the scale factor Hessian within the linearized least squares approximation."
.iL

If SF_HESS = INPUT, the SF_HESS_DIAG vector must be specified.
The ANAL option is recommended, as it employs a full second-order
algorithm using the Newton-Raphson method.  This choice 
provides the most rapid and cost-effective convergence.  The LLS option
employs a Newton-Raphson method but with the analytic Hessian 
appropriate for a linear least-squares problem.  Convergence is significantly
degraded relative to ANAL in the later iterations.  The NUM_FD option
is not as cost-effective as either ANAL or LLS, even though convergence is
obtained in the same number of steps as ANAL.  The primary use of this
option is to test the analytic Hessians computed by the ANAL option.  Note that the
Hessian is printed at each iteration to the CHECK file.  The INPUT option
provides rapid iterations, but several cycles may be required for convergence.
This option allows one to damp the initial steps by appropriate choice
of the diagonal elements of the inverse Hessian.  Both GUESS and INPUT
utilize a Davidon-Fletcher-Powell scheme with cubic interpolation.

.IP "\fBSF_HESS_DIAG =\fP \fIreal_array\fP"
If SF_HESS = INPUT, then SF_HESS_DIAG specifies the diagonal elements
of the inverse of the scale factor Hessian.  The length of the array is the number
of scale factors used (see SCALE_FACTORS above).  

.IP "\fBWEIGHT = \fP \fIinteger\fP"
This keyword determines how the weights are set in the SQMFC analysis.
A value of 0 sets weights for each frequency to the inverse of the
frequency, a value of 1 sets all weights equal to 1, and a value of 
2 sets weights according to the reciprocal of the square of the frequencies.
The default is 0 (recommended by Pulay et al.)  Weights may be overridden for
specific frequencies in the FUNDAMENTALS input (\fIvide supra\fP).  All
weights are normalized before scale factor optimization begins.

.SH FORMAT OF IDER.DAT FILE
.IP
If TRANS_TYPE = I_TO_C_R the unique internal coordinate derivatives
which are nonzero are read in from the 
.pN IDER
file, which is produced by the
.B intdif
program.

.SH INTERNAL COORDINATE SPECIFICATION
The definition of internal coordinates is nearly the same as for the
.B bmat
program.  However, there have been several changes and additions since the
original
.B intder
program.  The following is a summary of the internal coordinate specifications
for the new 
.B INTDER95 
program.  See intco(2) for a description of how to set up the
.B intco
input for compatibility with  older programs such as 
.B intder
and
.B bmat.

The
.B intco
section of the input is used to define the internal coordinates
used by \fBINTDER95\fP(1).  These internal coordinates consist
of two types,
.I simple
internal coordinates and
.I symmetrized
internal coordinates.  The symmetrized internal coordinates are
symmetry-adapted linear combinations (SALCs) of the simple internal
coordinates.

.SS SIMPLE INTERNAL COORDINATES
.LP
The following types of simple internal coordinates are valid:
.iO     TYPE
.iV         "STRE"   "for bond stretching coordinates"
.iV         "BEND"   "for valence bond angle coordinates"
.iV         "OUT"    "for out-of-plane bending coordinates"
.iV         "TORS"   "for torsion coordinates"
.iV         "LIN1"
for the deformation of a linear chain of atoms in the plane perpendicular to
a specified direction vector
.iV         "SPF"
Simons-Parr-Finlan coordinates for bond lengths, i.e.,
.if n 1-r0/r.
.if t 1-r\s-2\d0\u\s0/r.
.iV         "LINX" 
for the deformation of a linear chain of atoms in the plane containing a fourth
atom
.iV         "LINY"
for the deformation of a linear chain of atoms perpendicular to the plane containing a fourth
atom
.iV         "RCOM"
for center-of-mass separation coordinates between intermolecular fragments.

.LP
The simple internal coordinates are entered as:
.DS

  \fBTYPE \fP= (
    (\fIindex A B \fP<\fIC\fP> <\fID\fP>)
    (  "   " "   "  "   "  ) (\fRrepeat this until
    (  "   " "   "  "   "  )  all simples of this
    (  "   " "   "  "   "  )  type are defined)
    )
.DE
.LP
where
.I index
is a label used in the SYMM and ASYMM vectors,
.I A-D
are atom labels.
Note, the indices must run from 1 to \fInsim \fPwhere
nsim is the total number of simple internal coordinates.
The atom labels are defined as follows:
.iO
For 
.B STRE,
the coordinate is the A-B bond distance, and the order of A and B does not
matter.  (C and D must not be given.)
.iO
For 
.B BEND,
it is the A-B-C bond angle.  A and C can be exchanged but the central atom
must be B.  (D must not be given.)
.iO
For 
.B OUT,
the coordinate is the angle between the AB vector and the plane containing
C-B-D.  The coordinate is positive if A is on the same side of
the plane as the vector 
(B->C) X (B->D) (that is, the cross product of the vector from atom B to atom C and
the vector from atom B to atom D).  Note that the central atom comes second
here and that C and D can be exchanged but that this changes the sign of
the coordinate.
.iO
For 
.B TORS,
the coordinate is defined as the angle between the planes ABC and BCD.
Note that ABCD and DCBA are equivalent.
.iO
For 
.B LIN1,
the coordinate is the bending of the linear chain of atoms ABC in
the plane perpendicular to the vector D.  
The vector D is input as dummy atom coordinates (
.I vide supra,
DUMMY_ATOMS).
LIN1 is positive if (B->C) X (B->A) (that is, the cross product of the vector
from atom B to atom C and the vector from atom B to atom A) is in the same 
direction as the D vector.
.iO
For
.B SPF,
the coordinate involves the A-B bond distance, and the order of A and B
does not matter.  SPF is different from all other simple coordinates in
that C, if specified, is \fIreal \fPrather than an integer.  C, if given,
is the reference bond length
.if n r0.
.if t r\s-2\d0\u\s0.  
If C=0.0 the current value of the A-B bond length is taken as the
reference.
.iO
For 
.B LINX
the coordinate is the x component of the
.B c -> d
unit vector in the local coordinate system in which the 
.B b -> c
vector defines the +z axis and the 
.B a
atom lies in the xz plane in the +x direction.
.iO
For 
.B LINY
the coordinate is the y component of the
.B c -> d
unit vector in the local coordinate system in which the 
.B b -> c
vector defines the +z axis and the 
.B a
atom lies in the xz plane in the +x direction.
.iO
For
.B RCOM
the coordinate is the distance between the center of mass of fragment A
(range of atoms: [
.B a,b
]) and that of fragment B (range of atoms: [
.B c,d
]).  Specification of this coordinate type necessitates input of masses.

.LP
So, for example, the simple internal coordinates for water would be:
.LP
.DS
intco: (
  stre = (
   (1 1 2)
   (2 1 3))
  bend = (
   (3 2 1 3))
 )
.DE
.LP
where the oxygen is atom 1, and the hydrogens are atoms 2 and 3.

.SS SYMMETRIZED INTERNAL COORDINATES
.LP
The definition of symmetrized internal coordinates is a little more
complex.  \fBSYMM \fP and \fBASYMM \fP arrays are constructed which define
the totally symmetric and asymmetric symmetrized internal coordinates, respectively.
.LP
The symmetry internal coordinates are entered as:
.DS
  \fBsymm \fP= (
    (\fIlabel (\fIinteger array\fP) \fP<(\fIreal array\fP)>)
    (  "   " "   "  "   "  ) (\fRrepeat this until
    (  "   " "   "  "   "  )  all symmetric coordinates 
    (  "   " "   "  "   "  )  are defined)
    )
.DE
.DS
  \fBasymm \fP= (
    (\fIlabel (\fIinteger array\fP) \fP<(\fIreal array\fP)>)
    (  "   " "   "  "   "  ) (\fRrepeat this until
    (  "   " "   "  "   "  )  all asymmetric coordinates 
    (  "   " "   "  "   "  )  are defined)
    )
.DE
.LP
where
.I label
is a string used to denote the particular symmetry coordinate, 
.I integer array
lists the numbers of the simple internal coordinates involved in the
symmetry coordinate (including a positive or negative sign for the linear
combination), and
.I real array
is an optional array of the coefficients of each simple internal coordinate
in the symmetry coordinate.
For the water example, above, the symmetry coordinates would be specified in the 
.B intco
input section by:
.LP
.DS
intco: (
  stre = (
   (1 1 2)
   (2 1 3))
  bend = (
   (3 2 1 3))

  symm = (
    ("o-h symm st" (1 2) (1.0 1.0))
    ("oh2 bend" (3 1 2))
    }
  asymm = (
    ("o-h asymm st" (1 -2)(1.0 1.0))
    )
  )
.DE
.LP
If the optional coefficients are not specified they default to 1.0.
