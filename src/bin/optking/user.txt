The optking program performs optimization of molecular geometries using
analytic gradients, and possibly the second derivative.  The default minimization 
procedure employs redundant internal coordinates, an RFO step, BFGS Hessian update, 

Optimizations are peformed in redundant internal coordinates.  The principal literature
references include the introduction of redundant internal coordinates in:
C. Peng, P.Y. Ayala,  H.B. Schlegel, and M.J. Frisch, J. Comput. Chem., 17, 49 (1996).

The general algorithm employed in this code is the "model Hessian" plus "RF method"
described and tested in:
V. Bakken and T. Helgaker, J. Chem. Phys., 117, 9160 (2002).

For separated fragments, we connect by only the single, nearest atoms
We choose not to employ their "extra-redundant" internal coordinates defined by
"auxiliary interfragment" bonds.

The initial Hessian guess is either "SCHLEGEL" defined in:
Schlegel, Theor. Chim. Acta, 66, 333 (1984)   _or_
or "FISCHER" defined in:
Fischer and Almlof, J. Phys. Chem., 96, 9770 (1992).
For the interfragment coordinates (if present), the initial guess can be computed
using the Fischer formulas (INTERFRAGMENT_H == FISCHER_LIKE).  By default,
the interfragment coordinates that are stretches, bends, and dihedral angles are given
the force constants 0.007, 0.003, and 0.001 au, respectively.

Hydrogen bonds are identified as not bonded according to the covalent criteria, and
including the bonding pattern [N,O,F,Cl]-H ... [N,O,F,Cl].  The distance must be
less than 4.3 au (changeable by "MAXIMUM_H_BOND_DISTANCE"), and the X-H ... Y angle must
be greater than 90 degrees.  If an interfragment stretch is (or includes) a hydrogen bond, 
the the default guess at the force constants that are stretches, bends, and dihedral angles
are larger: 0.03, 0.007, and 0.002 respectively.


The default Hessian update scheme is the popular BFGS scheme.  Other options include
the MS, POWELL, and BOFILL updates (no update scheme is NO).  The number of previous steps'
data to be used in the update can be controlled by the user (H_update_use_last).

If H_UPDATE_LIMIT = true, then changes to the Hessian from updating are limited in magnitude.
Specifically, if changes cannot exceed the maximum of H_UPDATE_LIMIT_SCALE times the previous
value of the Hessian element, or H_UPDATE_LIMIT_MAX (in au). 

See Schlegel _Ab Initio Methods in Quantum Chemistry_ (1987) for definitions, as well as
J. M. Bofill, J. Comp. Chem., Vol. 15, pages 1-11 (1994).

The coordinate type is followed by a "*" for a frozen coordinate.
Frozen interfragment coordinates are selected by placing a "*" after the "1" of the
corresponding coordinate.

Currently, all interfragment stretches are R(AB) coordinates.
 If INTERFRAGMENT_DISTANCE_INVERSE=true, then 1/R(AB) coordinates are used for all interfragment stretches.
