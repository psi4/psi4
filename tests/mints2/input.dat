#! A test of the basis specification.  A benzene atom is defined using a ZMatrix containing dummy atoms
#! and various basis sets are assigned to different atoms.  The symmetry of the molecule is automatically
#! lowered to account for the different basis sets.

# Here we specify some of the basis sets manually.  They could be written to one or more external
# files and included with the command
#
# basis file relative/path/to/basis.file
#
# or
#
# basis file /absolute/path/to/basis.file
#
# The format of these external files follows the same format as those below, where there's a [name]
# tag before the standard G94 basis set specification:

# The keywords cartesian or spherical are optional and provide default behavior if the 
# puream keyword is not set.  Multiple basis sets can appear in the same file, as long 
# as there is a [name] tag above the definition of each basis set. The basis sets specified 
# using either "basis" or "basis file" keywords are utilized first (in the order specified 
# in the input file).  Any remaining basis sets required are extracted from the built-in library, 
# if they exist, or an error message is printed.
basis  {
#
# We start by assigning basis sets to atoms.  These commands can go anywhere in the basis block
#
   # First, assign DZ to all atoms
   assign DZ
   # Now, assign 3-21G to all carbon atoms
   assign C my3-21G
   # The two atoms labelled H1 get a STO-3G basis two
   assign H1 sto-3g
   # Carbons 3 and 5 get a STO-3G basis, too
   assign C1 sto-3g
   # With all these in place, the symmetry is lowered to C2v automatically
   # The commands are applied in order i.e., adding a line like
   # assign cc-pvtz
   # here would override all of the above and assign cc-pvtz to all atoms

#
# Now we define the basis sets.  N.B. Indentation does not matter; it just looks prettier.

    [my3-21G] #This is really the standard 3-21G basis, but with a different name
