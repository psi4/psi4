#! Make sure job doesn't crash if number of MO's changes during optimization
#! Choose S_TOLERANCE such that the number of linear dependencies will drop
#! (and the number of retained MO's will rise) when we are on the second
#! geometry step.  Formerly this caused a LIBPSIO TOC overwrite error.
#! Now it shouldn't because we just make an all-new file32 checkpoint 
#! file after each SCF run.  David Sherrill 3/19/14.
