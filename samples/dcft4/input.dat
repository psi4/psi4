#! DCFT calculation for the HF+ using DCFT-06 functional. This performs both
#! two-step and simultaneous update of the orbitals and cumulant using DIIS extrapolation.
#! Four-virtual integrals are first handled in the MO Basis for the first two energy computations.
#! In the next two the ao_basis=disk algorithm is used, where the transformation of integrals for 
#! four-virtual case is avoided.
