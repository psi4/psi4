First, an initial CISD computation is run to get the natural orbitals; this allows a meaningful partitioning of the virtual orbitals into groups of different importance.  Next, the RASCI is run.  The split-virtual CISD[TQ] takes all singles and doubles, and all triples and quadruples with no more than 2 electrons in the secondary virtual subspace (RAS 3).  If any electrons are present in the tertiary virtual subspace (RAS 4), then that excitation is only allowed if it is a single or double.

castup3:      SCF with various combinations of pk/density-fitting, castup/no-castup, and spherical/cartesian settings. Demonstrates that puream setting is getting set by orbital basis for all df/castup parts of calc. Demonstrates that answer doesn't depend on presence/absence of castup. Demonstrates (by comparison to castup2) that output file doesn't depend on options (scf_type) being set global or local. This input uses local.
