#! RHF cc-pVDZ energy for water, automatically scanning the symmetric stretch and bending coordinates
#! using Python's built-in loop mechanisms.  The geometry is apecified using a Z-matrix with variables
#! that are updated during the potential energy surface scan, and then the same procedure is performed
#! using polar coordinates, converted to Cartesian coordinates.
