#! A test of the basis specification.  A benzene atom is defined using a ZMatrix containing dummy atoms
#! and various basis sets are assigned to different atoms.  The symmetry of the molecule is automatically
#! lowered to account for the different basis sets.

# The format of these external files follows the same format as those below, where there's a [name]

# The keywords cartesian or spherical are optional and provide default behavior if the

# as there is a [name] tag above the definition of each basis set. The basis sets specified 
# using either "basis" or "basis file" keywords are utilized first (in the order specified 
# in the input file).  Any remaining basis sets required are extracted from the built-in library, 
# if they exist, or an error message is printed.
