#! Test of the superposition of atomic densities (SAD) guess, using a highly distorted water
#! geometry with a cc-pVDZ basis set.  This is just a test of the code and the user need only
#! specify guess=sad to the SCF module's (or global) options in order to use a SAD guess. The
#! test is first performed in C2v symmetry, and then in C1.
