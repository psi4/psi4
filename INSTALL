  VI. Common Problems with PSI Compilation

----------------------------------

I. Compilation Prerequisites:

   * C++ Compiler
   * F77 Compiler (the F95 compiler, gfortran, with gcc-4.X will work)
     --> Note: The F77 compiler is only used to determine the symbol-naming
     convention of and some system routines for the BLAS and LAPACK libraries
     on a few architectures.  It is optional in a few cases (e.g. Mac OS X
     systems).
   * Optimized BLAS library (preferably NOT one supplied by a standard
     Linux distribution; see recommendations below)
   * Optimized LAPACK library (preferably NOT one supplied by a standard
     Linux distribution; see recommendations below)
   * POSIX threads (Pthreads) library (optional)
   * Python interpreter (2.4 or higher)
   * Python developer libraries corresponding to your interpreter.
   * A version of MPI is required to compile distributed-parallel PSI; 
     MPICH2 is recommended.
     (Note: MPICH2-1.1.0 had trouble with some header files.  MPICH2-1.2.1
     seems to fix it.)
   * GNU utilities: (see http://www.gnu.org)
      ** make
      ** autoconf (version 2.52 or higher, only needed for special
                   architectures, to compile with MADNESS, or to compile the 
                   development branch)
      ** aclocal
      ** fileutils (esp. install)
   * For documentation: (available off http://www.psicode.org)
      ** latex
      ** sphinx (version 1.1 or higher)
      ** dvipng (for latex math in html)
   * To make a distributed-parallel version with MADNESS, you may also need:
      ** libtool (called by autoreconf)

   To check to see if you have the Python developer libraries installed look
   for the Python config program. If you Python interpreter is named `python'
   look for the config program `python-config', likewise if your interpreter
   is named `python2.6' your config program is named `python2.6-config'. If
   you cannot find the config program the developer libraries will not be
   detected and the PSI4 configure script will fail.  

   For Fedora users, the python development library is called python-devel

   For Ubuntu users, you will need the following packages installed:
   gfortran [for linking to BLAS/LAPACK], g++, autoconf, python-dev 


II. Brief Summary of Configruation, Compilation, and Installation

This section outlines the main steps of configuring, compiling, and
installing PSI.  More detail is given below in Section III.

A. Autoconf

1. For unusual architectures (or for developers working in the development
branch), one needs to first run autoconf to generate
the file "configure" in the top-level psi4 directory.  For most Linux
and Mac compilations, this should not be necessary because the configure
file provided with PSI4 should be sufficient.  To replace the general
configure file with one specific to your architecture, in the top-level
psi4 directory, run autoconf:

   * autoconf

2. Distributed-parallel compilation.

Not recommended at this time except by developers.  Shared-memory
parallelization is already enabled by default in the standard
compilation.

Distributed-parallel versions of PSI4 require madness. If you select
mpicxx as the compiler, the distributed-parallel version (including
madness) will compile. For distributed-parallel compilation, you must
run the following command in the madness directory, otherwise the PSI4
configure script will fail (autoreconf is provided by package autoconf,
but it calls another program provided by libtool, so that package must
also be installed):

   * cd madness
   * autoreconf
   * cd ..

B. Configuration and Compilation

Make an object directory in which you can compile the code

   * mkdir obj

Next, you need to configure the code, make it, and run the tests.

Either

   * cd obj
   * [run ../configure with one of the options below]
   * make
   * make tests
   * make install [if tests pass]
   * [do user configuration, see below]

or, if you want to save your configuration options for a future compilation,
then in the top-level psi4 directory,

   * [create a file like "do-configure" with your configuration options,
      e.g., as below]
   * chmod u+x do-configure
   * cd obj
   * ../do-configure
   * make
   * make tests
   * make install [if tests pass]
   * [do user configuration, see below]

That's it!  The details about configuration are given below.  If something
goes wrong, check section VI about common compilation problems.


III. Detailed Installation Instructions

This section provides a more detailed explanation of the procedure for
compiling and installing the PSI4 package.

Step 1: Configuration

A. General Information about Configuration

First, we recommend that you choose for the top-level psi4 source
directory something other than /usr/local/psi; $HOME/psi4 or
/usr/local/src/psi4 are convenient choices.  Next, in the top-level psi4
source directory you've chosen, first run autoconf to generate the configure
script from configure.ac.  It is best to keep the source code separate
from the compilation area, so you must first choose a subdirectory for
compilation of the codes.  A simple option is $PSI4/objdir, which should
work for most environments.  However, if you need executables for several
architectures, you should choose more meaningful subdirectory names.

   * The compilation directory will be referred to as $objdir for the
   remainder of these instructions.

In $objdir, run the configure script found in the PSI4 top-level source
directory.  This script will scan your system to locate certain libraries,
header files, etc. needed for complete compilation.  The script accepts a
number of options, all of which are listed above.  The most important of
these is the --prefix option, which selects the installation directory for
the executables, the libraries, header files, basis set data, and other
administrative files.  The default --prefix is /usr/local/psi.

   * The configure script's --prefix directory will be referred to as
   $prefix for the remainder of these instructions.

Besides --prefix, PSI often needs a few additional options for the
configure script.  To make it reasy to recompile later (especially if
you're a developer), it can be convenient (but not necessary) to to put
the configure options in a small executable file, so you can re-do the
configuration later very easily. Let us assume that we will be putting
the configure options in a file named do-configure, in the top-level
psi4 directory (we'll keep it up there instead of down in the compilation
directory $objdir, so that if we delete the compilation directory later,
we'll still have the do-configure file). In the following examples,
we have sometimes split the configure options over multiple lines
for readability. However, they should all be on the same line in the
do-configure script.

Note: The configure options below are for the most common architectures and
compilers. The developers would appreciate it if you would share any special
configuration options that might be needed for less commonly encountered
situations. 

For g++, if you have BLAS and LAPACK in standard locations (like /usr/lib64),
configuration is very easy. Pick one of the following scenarios, and place the
text given in the psi4/do-configure file (all on one long line). Replace the
text after prefix with whatever directory you want to use for your
installation directory.

* Intel compiler with MKL math library [highly recommended; if you don't use
this, then at least make sure you have a threaded BLAS (see BLAS
recommendations below)]

   Note: there seems to be a problem with icpc 12.0.2 and possibly earlier
12.0 versions, giving an error like: 

   error: identifier "__is_trivial" is undefined.

Use at least version 12.0.4.

   ../configure --prefix=/usr/local/psi4 --with-blas='-mkl' --with-cc=icc --with-cxx=icpc --with-fc=ifort  --with-opt='-O2 -static -no-prec-div' --with-incdirs=-mkl

Note: it's -mkl, not -lmkl.

* g++, optimized
   ../configure --prefix=/usr/local/psi4

* g++, for debugging
   ../configure --prefix=/usr/local/psi4 --without-opt --with-debug


* Compiling for Mac
To get the compilers needed, it's easiest to install XCode. However, XCode
does not provide a Fortran compiler. Although Fortran compilers are not needed
to compile Psi, a broken one can prevent Psi from configuring properly. Do not
download the latest version of GFortran from the HPC website; this is unlikely
to be compatible with your version of GCC. Instead, you should run

   gcc -v

to find out what version of GCC you're using, and then download the
corresponding GFortran from  here. If you configure Psi on a Mac without any
Fortran compiler it will set itself up correctly, so this is only necessary if
you want a Fortran compiler for other purposes. You can configure Psi by
adding something like

   ../configure --with-plugins

to the do-configure script. If you want to use the new LLVM compilers that
ship with XCode 4 (they compile quicker than GCC), use

   ../configure --with-plugins --with-cxx=llvm-g++

If you still happen to encouter an error like:

checking Fortran symbols... giving up
configure: error: could not determine fortran symbol names

adding the following tag to your configure may help:

   --with-f77symbol=lcu

B. List of Specific Configuration Options

The example configuration options in the previous subsection are usually
sufficient.  However, if not, you may need to make use of one or more
of the following options to the configure script:

   * --prefix=directory --- Use this option if you wish to install the
   PSI4 package somewhere other than the default directory, /usr/local/psi.

   * --with-cxx=compiler --- Use this option to specify a C++ compiler.
   One should use compilers that generate reentrant code, if possible.
   The default search order for compilers is: xlC_r (AIX only), g++, c++,
   icpc, cxx.  For distributed-parallel compilation, MPI is required and 
   you need to use mpicxx (where this has been added to your PATH).

   * --with-fc=compiler --- Use this option to specify a Fortran-77 compiler,
   which is used to determine linking coventions for BLAS and LAPACK libraries
   and to provide system routines for those libraries.  Note that no fortran
   compiler is necessary on Mac OS X systems (see below).  The default search
   order for compilers is: xlf_r (AIX only), gfortran, g77, ifort, f77, f2c.

   * --with-f77symbol=value --- This option allows manual assignment of the 
   FORTRAN77 symbol convention, which is necessary for C programs to link
   Fortran-interface libraries such as BLAS and LAPACK. This option should
   only be used by experts and even then should almost never be necessary. 
   Allowed values are:
                            lc  : lower-case
                            lcu : lower-case with underscore (default)
                            uc  : upper-case
                            ucu : upper-case with underscore

   * --with-ld=linker --- Use this option to specify a linker.  The
   default is 'ld'.

   * --with-ar=archiver --- Use this option to specify an archiver.  The
   default is to look for 'ar' automatically.

   * --with-ar-flags=flags --- Use this option to specify additional archiver 
   flags. The default is 'r'.

   * --with-incdirs=directories --- Use this option to specify extra
   directories where to look for header files. Directories should be specified
   prepended by '-I', i.e. '-Idir1 -Idir2', etc. If several directories are 
   specified, enclose the list with single right-quotes, e.g.,
   --with-incdirs='-I/usr/local/include -I/home/psi4/include'.

   * --with-libs=libraries --- Use this option to specify extra
   libraries which should be used during linking. Libraries should be 
   specified by their full names or in the usual '-l' notation, e.g. 
   '-lm /usr/lib/libm.a', etc.  If several libraries are specified, enclose 
   the list with single right-quotes, e.g., --with-libs='-libm -lgcc_s'.

   * --with-libdirs=directories --- Use this option to specify extra
   directories where to look for libraries. Directories should be specified
   prepended by '-L', i.e. '-Ldir1 -Ldir2', etc. If several directories are 
   specified, enclose the list with single right-quotes, e.g.,
   --with-libdirs='-L/usr/local/lib -I/home/psi4/lib'.

   * --with-blas=library --- Use this option to specify a BLAS library.
   If your BLAS library has multiple components, enclose the file list
   with single right-quotes, e.g., --with-blas='-lf77blas -latlas'.  Note
   that many BLAS libraries can be detected automatically.

   * --with-lapack=library --- Use this option to specify a LAPACK library.
   If your LAPACK library has multiple components, enclose the file list
   with single right-quotes, e.g., --with-lapack='-llapack -lcblas -latlas'.
   Note that many LAPACK libraries can be detected automatically.

   * --with-max-am-eri=integer --- Specifies the maximum angular momentum
   level for the primitive Gaussian basis functions when computing
   electron repulsion integrals.  This is set to g-type functions (AM=4)
   by default.

   * --with-max-am-deriv1=integer --- Specifies the maximum angular
   momentum level for first derivatives of the primitive Gaussian
   basis functions.  This is set to f-type functions (AM=3) by default.

   * --with-max-am-deriv2=integer --- Specifies the maximum angular
   momentum level for second derivatives of the primitive Gaussian
   basis functions.  This is set to d-type functions (AM=2) by default.

   * --with-max-am-r12=integer --- Specifies the maximum angular momentum
   level for primitive Gaussian basis functions used in r_12 explicitly
   correlated methods.  This is set to f-type functions (AM=3) by default.

   * --with-debug=yes/no --- Turns on debugging flags (-g) if yes.  This is
   set to no by default.

   * --with-opt=yes/no --- Turns off compiler optimizations (-OX) if no.
   This is set to yes by default.

   * --with-strict=yes -- Turns on strict compiler warnings.

 Python interpreter:

   Usually Python will be detected automatically.  If this fails, or if
   you have multiple versions installed and want to specify a particular
   one, set the PYTHON environmental variable to the full path name
   of the Python interpreter you want to use.  This defaults to the
   `python' in your path. For example, if you want to use
   `python2.6' located in /usr/bin set the environmental variable to be:

      PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2.6

   Please note if set the variable the config program must be present with
   a similar name. For instance, in the above example the following must
   exist:

      /usr/bin/python2.6-config

   You either set the environmental variable before you call configure, or
   tell configure about it:

      ./configure PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2.6

 Boost Libraries:

   PSI4 can use a user-provided boost C++ library, or, alternatively,
   comes bundled with boost 1.48.0, which PSI4 can automatically
   build. By default, PSI4 will look in your include/library paths for
   a compatible and complete boost installation (boost 1.46 or newer). A
   boost installation in a nonstandard location can be specified by the
   --with-boost=PATH and --with-boost-libdir=PATH configure flags. If a
   default or user-specified boost installation is found to be incomplete,
   incompatible, or nonexistent, boost 1.48.0 will be unpacked automatically
   and built as part of the PSI4 build process.

   Required Compiled Boost Modules (all Boost 1.46.0 or later): 

   * Filesystem
   * Python
   * Regex
   * Serialization
   * System
   * Thread

   Relevant Configure Options:

   * --with-boost[=ARG] use Boost library from a standard location
   (ARG=yes), from the specified location (ARG=<path>), or disable
   it (ARG=no) [ARG=yes]

   * --with-boost-libdir=LIB_DIR  
   Force given directory for boost libraries. Note that this will override
   library path detection, so use this parameter only if default library
   detection fails and you know exactly where your boost libraries are
   located. 
 
   * --with-boost-filesystem[=special-lib] 
   use the Filesystem library from boost - it is possible to specify a 
   certain library for the linker e.g. 
   --with-boost-filesystem=boost_filesystem-gcc-mt

   * --with-boost-python specify the boost python library or suffix to use 

   * --with-boost-regex[=special-lib] 
   use the Regex library from boost - it is possible to specify a certain
   library for the linker e.g. --with-boost-regex=boost_regex-gcc-mt-d-1_33_1 

   * --with-boost-serialization[=special-lib] 
   use the Serialization library from boost - it is possible to specify a
   certain library for the linker e.g.
   --with-boost-serialization=boost_serialization-gcc-mt-d-1_33_1 

   * --with-boost-system[=special-lib] 
   use the System library from boost - it is possible to specify a certain
   library for the linker e.g. --with-boost-system=boost_system-gcc-mt 

   * --with-boost-thread[=special-lib] 
   use the Thread library from boost - it is possible to specify a certain
   library for the linker e.g. --with-boost-thread=boost_thread-gcc-mt 


Step 2: Compilation

Running "make" (which must be GNU's 'make' utility) in $objdir will compile
the PSI4 libraries and executable modules.

Step 3: Testing

To execute automatically the ever-growing number of test cases after
compilation, simply execute "make tests" in the $objdir directory.
This will run each (relatively small) test case and report the results.
Failure of any of the test cases should be reported to the developers.
By default, any such failure will stop the testing process.  If you desire
to run the entire testing suit without interruption, execute "make tests
TESTFLAGS='-u -q'". Note that you must do a "make testsclean" in $objdir
to run the test suite again.

Step 4: Installation

Once testing is complete, installation into $prefix is accomplished by
running "make install" in $objdir.   Executable modules are installed in
$prefix/bin, include files in $prefix/include, libraries in $prefix/lib, and 
documentation, basis set data, and various control strctures $prefix/share.

Step 5: Building Documentation

This is not recommended because all of the documentation should be
available at www.psicode.org, and it is automatically updated.  However,
if your system has the appropriate utilities (notably the sphinx package
and LaTeX), you may build the package documentation from the top-level
$objdir by running "make doc".  The resulting files will appear in the
$prefix/doc area.

Step 6: Cleaning

All object files and libraries can be removed to save disk space by running
"make clean" in $objdir.

Step 7: User Configuration

After the PSI4 package has been successfullly installed, the user will need
to add the installation directory into his/her path.  If the package has
been installed in the default location /usr/local/psi, then in C shell,
the user should add something like the following to their .cshrc file:

  setenv PSI /usr/local/psi
  set path = ($path $PSI/bin)

Next, you need to create a file .psi4rc in each user's
home directory.  A sample file is provided in the PSI4 source
(psi4/samples/example_psi4rc_file).  This file tells the PSI4 I/O manager
how to handle scratch files.  

Copy this file to each user's home directory

  cp psi4/samples/example_psi4rc_file $HOME/.psi4rc

Now edit this file.  Replace the path in the following line

  psioh.set_default_path('/scratch/parrish/')

with a path to a fast scratch disk for which the user has write access.  Note:
This should NOT be an NFS-mounted volume, as writes to a remote disk over the
network can be very slow and can tie up the network and negatively impact
other users.  If the local /tmp volume is large enough, it might be used.
However, a dedicated scratch volume (using RAID0 striping for speed) is
recommended.

For developers: during compilation and testing, PSI4 finds its basis sets,
grids, etc., in psi4/lib.  After installation, PSI4 will look in 
$prefix/share/psi.  If you want to specify a non-standard location for this
information, you can do this by setting the environmental variable
$PSI4DATADIR to the directory containg the basis, grids, etc.,
subdirectories.

IV. Recommendations for BLAS and LAPACK libraries

Much of the speed and efficiency of the PSI4 programs depends on the
corresponding speed and efficiency of the available BLAS and LAPACK libraries
(especially the former).  In addition, the most common compilation problems
involve these libraries.  Users may therefore wish to consider the following
BLAS and LAPACK recommendations when building PSI4:

  (1) It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many
  Linux distributions like RedHat.  This library is usually just the
  netlib distribution and is completely unoptimized.  PSI4's performance
  will suffer if you choose this route.  The choice of LAPACK is less
  critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.
  If you do choose to use the RedHat/Fedora stock BLAS and LAPACK, be
  aware that some RPM's do not make the correct symbolic links.  
  For example, you may have /usr/lib/libblas.so.3.1.0 but not
  /usr/lib/libblas.so.  If this happens, create the link as, e.g.,
  ln -s /usr/lib/libblas.so.3.1.0 /usr/lib/libblas.so.  You
  may need to do similarly for lapack.

  (2) Perhaps the best and simplest choice, if you have it available,
  is Intel's MKL library, which includes BLAS and LAPACK (note: use
  version 11 or later, we had difficulty with version 10 for very
  large coupled-cluster computations).  MKL is efficient and works
  well in threaded mode.  Other alternatives include Kazushige Goto's
  hand-optimized BLAS (http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/resources/software/)
  and ATLAS (http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/).  These work well on
  nearly every achitecture to which the PSI4 developers have access,
  though we have identified at least one case in which the Goto libraries
  yielded faulty DGEMM calls.  On Mac OS X systems, the vecLib package
  that comes with Xcode works well.

  (3) PSI4 does not require a Fortran compiler, unless the resident BLAS
  and LAPACK libraries require Fortran-based system libraries.  If you see
  compiler complaints about missing symbols like "do_fio" or "e_wsfe", then
  your libraries were most likely compiled with g77 or gfortran, which
  require -lg2c to resolve the Fortran I/O calls.  Use of the same gcc
  package for PSI4 should normally resolve this problem.

  (4) The PSI4 configure script can often identify and use several
  different BLAS and LAPACK libraries, but its ability to do this
  automatically depends on a number of factors, including correspondence
  between the compiler used for PSI4 and the compiler used to build
  BLAS/LAPACK, placement of the libraries in commonly searched directories,
  etc. PSI4's configure script will find your BLAS and LAPACK if any of the
  the following are installed in standard locations (e.g. /usr/local/lib):

    (a) ATLAS: libf77blas.a and libatlas.a, plus netlib's liblapack.a
    (b) MKL 8: libmkl.so and libmkl_lapack64.a (with the corresponding
        Intel compilers)
    (c) Goto: libgoto.a and netlib's liblapack.a
    (d) Cray SCSL (e.g. on SGI Altix): libscs.so (NB: No Fortran compiler
        is necessary in this case, so --with-fc=no should work.)
    (e) ESSL (e.g. on AIX systems): libessl.a

  (5) If configure cannot identify your BLAS and LAPACK libraries
  automatically, you can specify them on the command-line using the
  --with-blas and --with-lapack arguments described above.  Here are a few
  examples that work on the PSI4 developers' systems:

    (a) Linux with ATLAS:

    --with-blas='-lf77blas -latlas' --with-lapack='-llapack -lcblas'

    (b) Mac OS X with vecLib:

    --with-blas='-altivec -framework vecLib' --with-lapack=' '

    (c) Linux with MKL 8.1 and icc/icpc/ifort 9.1:

    --with-libdirs=-L/usr/local/opt/intel/mkl/8.0.2/lib/32 --with-blas=-lmkl --with-lapack=-lmkl_lapack32

    (d) Linux on ia32 with MKL 10.1 and icc/icpc 11.0:

    --with-blas='-Wl,--start-group -L/usr/local/opt/intel/mkl/10.1.0.015/lib/32 -l mkl -Wl,--end-group -lguide -lpthread'

Compilation notes for ATLAS:

   These shortcut notes might be helpful if you are using Linux.  However,
   we recommend reading and following the full ATLAS installation notes.

   You'll need a Fortran compiler installed.   

   Unpack the source code, then make a compilation directory (could
   be an obj subdirectory in the source directory, or elsewhere).

   Turn off CPU throttling so the auto-tuning capabilities have a chance
   to work.  On Linux, this can be tune using

     /usr/bin/cpufreq-selector -g performance

   cd into the compilation directory and run the source
   directory configure script there, with any necessary flags, e.g.,
     
     /usr/local/src/atlas/configure --prefix=/usr/local/atlas

   where prefix gives the installation directory.
   It should automatically detect if you're on an x86_64

   Then make and check using

     make; make check; make ptcheck

   And install

     make install
   

Compilation notes for netlib's LAPACK:

   These shortcut notes might be helpful if you are using Linux.  However,
   we recommend reading and following the full LAPACK installation notes.

   You'll need a Fortran compiler installed.

   If you decide to compile LAPACK from source, it may be obtained from 
   http://www.netlib.org/lapack/.  Unpack the source code, and in the
   top-level source directory, you need to create a make.inc file with
   the appropriate options for your machine.  For Linux/gfortran,
   simply 
  
     cp make.inc.example make.inc

   Next, edit BLASLIB in make.inc to point to your BLAS library
   (full pathnames are recommended):
 
     BLASLIB      = /home/david/software/atlas3.9.25/lib/libf77blas.a /home/david/software/atlas3.9.25/lib/libatlas.a

   Edit Makefile as necessary (probably not needed).

     make

   Copy the resulting file [lapack_($ARCH).a] where you want it
   (a standard location like /usr/local/lib is easier for PSI to find).
   It is probably helpful to rename the file liblapack.a.

     
V. Miscellaneous architecture-specific notes

 * Linux on x86 and x86_64:

   (1) Intel compilers: We had trouble with icpc 12.0.x.  Use 12.1 or
   later.

   (2) Some versions of RedHat/Fedora Core RPM packages for the 
   BLAS and LAPACK libraries fail to make all the required symlinks.  
   For example, you may have /usr/lib/libblas.so.3.1.0 but not
   /usr/lib/libblas.so.  If this happens, create the link as, e.g.,
   ln -s /usr/lib/libblas.so.3.1.0 /usr/lib/libblas.so.  You
   may need to do something similar for LAPACK.


VI. Common Problems with PSI Compilation

* Compilation dies in the integrals code when compiling with the -j flag

You can compile PSI with the -j flag to compile with multiple threads (e.g.,
-j2). The integrals code is not safe for this and will die. This is not a
problem, just type 'make' again, and compilation will resume. Once the
integrals are compiled, this shouldn't be a problem again. 

* No rule to make target foo.h, needed by bar.d. Stop.

This commonly happens after pulling updates from the repository. It happens
when a library header file is removed or renamed by the update, but there are
still old dependency files in the object directory, which think that they
still need to know about that header. There's a simple remedy, just run 

  make DODEPEND=no dclean

in the object directory.

* Make gets stuck in an infinite loop

This means that the makefiles have not been properly updated. Running

  autoconf

in the top-level Psi directory, followed by

  ./config.status --recheck
  ./config.status

in the object directory should fix it. This procedure will need to be run
whenever an update changes the directory structure. 

* Incompatible g++/icpc

The Intel compilers require an installed set of C++ headers. Unfortunately,
the GNU compilers tend to be more cutting-edge than the Intel compilers,
meaning that Intel is always playing catch-up to new features in g++. This
means the two are often incompatible, leading to trouble if one wants to use
icpc to compile PSI4 (or anything else...). Your best bet in general is to not
upgrade Linux too fast, and always keep the very latest Intel compilers
around.

* Missing symbols like "do_fio" or "e_wsfe"

See section IV(3) above.
