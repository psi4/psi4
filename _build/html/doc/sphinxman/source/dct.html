<p>Density cumulant theory (DCT) is a density-based <em>ab initio</em> theory
that can compute electronic energies without the use of a wavefunction. The
theory starts by writing the exact energy expression in terms of the one- and
two-particle density matrices (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\)</span>):</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[E = h_p^q \gamma_q^p + \frac{1}{2} g_{pq}^{rs} \gamma_{rs}^{pq}\]</div>
<p>Here we used Einstein convention for the summation over the repeated indices.
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_p^q\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g_{pq}^{rs}\)</span> are the standard one- and two-electron integrals, and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma_p^q\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma_{pq}^{rs}\)</span> are the elements of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\)</span>,
respectively. Naively, one might expect that it is possible to minimize the
energy functional in the equation above and obtain the exact energy. This is,
however, not trivial, as the density matrix elements <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma_p^q\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma_{pq}^{rs}\)</span> cannot be varied arbitrarily, but must satisfy some
conditions that make sure that the density matrices are N-representable, <em>i.e.</em>
correspond to an antisymmetric N-electron wavefunction. Unfortunately, no
simple set of necessary and sufficient N-representability conditions are known,
and some of the known conditions are not easily imposed. In addition, the lack
of separability of the density matrices may result in the loss of
size-consistency and size-extensivity. In DCT, one takes a different route and
replaces <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\)</span> in favor of its two-particle density cumulant:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\lambda_{pq}^{rs} = \gamma_{pq}^{rs} - \gamma_p^r \gamma_q^s + \gamma_p^s \gamma_q^r\]</div>
<p>The one-particle density matrix is separated into its idempotent part
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{\kappa}\)</span> and a correction <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{\tau}\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\gamma_p^q = \kappa_p^q + \tau_p^q\]</div>
<p>The idempotent part of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\)</span> corresponds to a mean-field Hartree--Fock-like density,
while the non-idempotent correction <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{\tau}\)</span>
depends on the density cumulant and describes the electron correlation effects.
Inserting the above two equations into the energy expression, we obtain:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[E_{DCT} = \frac{1}{2} \left( h_p^q + f_p^q \right) \gamma_q^p  + \frac{1}{4} \bar{g}_{pq}^{rs} \lambda_{rs}^{pq}\]</div>
<p>where the antisymmetrized two-electron integrals and the generalized Fock operator
matrix elements were defined as follows:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\bar{g}_{pq}^{rs} = g_{pq}^{rs} - g_{pq}^{sr}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[f_p^q = h_p^q + \bar{g}_{pr}^{qs} \gamma_{s}^{r}\]</div>
<p>Energy functional <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_{DCT}\)</span> has several important properties. First,
the energy is now a function of two sets of independent parameters, the
idempotent part of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\)</span> (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{\kappa}\)</span>) and the density cumulant
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{\lambda_2}\)</span>). As a result, the energy functional is Hermitian,
which is important for the evaluation of the molecular properties. The additive
separability of the density cumulant guarantees that all of the DCT methods
are size-extensive and size-consistent. Furthermore, the N-representability
problem is now greatly simplified, because the idempotent part of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\)</span> is
N-representable by construction. One only needs to worry about the
N-representability of the density cumulant, which is a relatively small part of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In order to obtain the DCT energy, two conditions must be satisfied:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The energy must be stationary with respect to a set of orbitals. This can be done by
diagonalizing the generalized Fock operator (as in the DC-06 and DC-12 methods, see below),
which introduces partial orbital relaxation, or by fully relaxing the orbitals and minimizing the entire energy expression
(as in the ODC-06 and ODC-12 methods).</p></li>
<li><p>The energy must be stationary with respect to the variation of the density
cumulant <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{\lambda_2}\)</span>, constrained to N-representability conditions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Making the energy stationary requires solution of two sets of coupled
equations for orbitals and density cumulant, respectively (also known as
residual equations). At the present moment, three different algorithms for the
solution of the system of coupled equations are available (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#sec-dctalgorithms"><span class="std std-ref">Iterative Algorithms</span></a> for details).</p>
<p>Publications resulting from the use of the DCT code should cite contributions
listed <a class="reference internal" href="introduction.html#intro-dctcitations"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="methods">
<span id="sec-dctmethods"></span><h2>Methods<a class="headerlink" href="#methods" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Currently five DCT methods (functionals) are available: DC-06, DC-12, ODC-06, ODC-12, and ODC-13. The first four
methods use approximate N-representability conditions derived from
second-order perturbation theory and differ in the description of the
correlated (non-idempotent) part <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{\tau}\)</span> of the one-particle density
matrix and orbital optimization. While in the DC-06 and ODC-06 methods <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{\tau}\)</span> is derived from the density cumulant
in an approximate way (labelled by '06'), the DC-12 and ODC-12 methods derive this contribution exactly, and
take full advantage of the N-representability conditions (which is denoted by '12'). The corresponding DC and ODC methods
have similar description of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\)</span> N-representability, but differ in describing the orbital relaxation:
the former methods account for the relaxation only partially, while the latter fully relax the orbitals.
Both DC-06 and DC-12 methods have similar computational cost, same is true when comparing ODC-06 and ODC-12.
Meanwhile, the DC methods are generally more efficient than their ODC analogs, due to a more expensive orbital update step
needed for the full orbital optimization. In the ODC-13 method, the third- and
fourth-order N-representability conditions are used for the density cumulant
and the correlated contribution <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{\tau}\)</span>, respectively,
and the orbitals are variationally optimized.
For most of the applications, it is recommended to use the ODC-12 method, which
provides an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency, especially for
molecules with open-shell character. If highly accurate results are desired, a
combination of the ODC-13 method with a three-particle energy correction
[<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{ODC-13$(\lambda_3)$}\)</span>] can be used (see below).
For the detailed comparison of the quality of these methods, we refer
users to our <a class="reference internal" href="introduction.html#intro-dctcitations"><span class="std std-ref">publications</span></a>.</p>
<p>The DCT functional can be specified by the <a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">|dct__dct_functional|</span></a> option. The
default choice is the ODC-12 functional. The DCT code can also be used to
compute the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\lambda_3)\)</span> energy correction that perturbatively accounts
for three-particle correlation effects, similarly to the (T) correction in coupled
cluster theory. Computation of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\lambda_3)\)</span> correction can be
requested by setting the <a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">|dct__three_particle|</span></a> option to PERTURBATIVE. A
combination of the ODC-13 functional with the  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\lambda_3)\)</span> correction
[denoted as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{ODC-13$(\lambda_3)$}\)</span>] has been shown to provide highly
accurate results for open-shell molecules near equilibrium geometries.</p>
<p>At the present moment, all of the DCT methods support unrestricted reference
orbitals (<a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">|scf__reference|</span></a> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">UHF</span></code>), which can be used to perform energy and
gradient computations for both closed- and open-shell molecules. In addition,
the ODC-06 and ODC-12 methods support restricted reference orbitals
(<a href="#id9"><span class="problematic" id="id10">|scf__reference|</span></a> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RHF</span></code>) for the energy and gradient computations of
closed-shell molecules. Note that in this case restricted reference orbitals
are only available for <a href="#id11"><span class="problematic" id="id12">|dct__algorithm|</span></a> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SIMULTANEOUS</span></code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="iterative-algorithms">
<span id="sec-dctalgorithms"></span><h2>Iterative Algorithms<a class="headerlink" href="#iterative-algorithms" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>As explained in the <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-dcttheory"><span class="std std-ref">Theory</span></a> section, in order to obtain the DCT energy one
needs to solve a system of coupled equations for orbitals and density
cumulant. At the present moment three iterative algorithms for the solution of the
equations are available. The choice of the algorithm is controlled using the
<a href="#id13"><span class="problematic" id="id14">|dct__algorithm|</span></a> option.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>SIMULTANEOUS [Default]</dt><dd><p>In the simultaneous algorithm the DCT equations are solved in macroiterations.
Each macroiteration consists of a single iteration of the cumulant update
followed by a single iteration of the orbital update and orbital transformation
of the integrals. The macroiterations are repeated until the simultaneous
convergence of the cumulant and orbitals is achieved.
Convergence of the simultaneous algorithm is accelerated using the
DIIS extrapolation technique.</p>
</dd>
<dt>TWOSTEP</dt><dd><p>In the two-step algorithm each macroiteration consists of two sets of
microiterations. In the first set, the density cumulant equations are solved
iteratively, while the orbitals are kept fixed. After the density cumulant is
converged, the second set of microiterations is performed for the
self-consistent update of the orbitals with the fixed density cumulant. Each
macroiteration is completed by performing the orbital transformation of the
integrals. As in the simultaneous algorithm, the DIIS
extrapolation is used to accelerate convergence. Two-step algorithm is
only available for the DC-06 and DC-12 methods.</p>
</dd>
<dt>QC</dt><dd><p>In the quadratically-convergent algorithm, the
orbital and cumulant update equations are solved using the Newton-Raphson
method. Each macroiteration of the quadratically-convergent algorithm consists
of a single Newton-Raphson update followed by the orbital transformation
of the integrals. The solution of the Newton-Raphson equations is performed
iteratively using the preconditioned conjugate gradients method, where only the
product of the electronic Hessian with the step vector is computed for
efficiency. By default, the electronic Hessian is build for both the cumulant and orbital
updates and both updates are performed simultaneously. Setting the <a href="#id15"><span class="problematic" id="id16">|dct__qc_type|</span></a>
option to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TWOSTEP</span></code> will perform the Newton-Raphson update only for the orbitals,
while the equations for the cumulant will be solved using a standard Jacobi update.
If requested by the user (set <a href="#id17"><span class="problematic" id="id18">|dct__qc_coupling|</span></a> to TRUE), the electronic Hessian can include
matrix elements that couple the orbitals and the density cumulant.
The computation of these coupling elements increases
the cost of the macroiteration, but usually leads to faster convergence and is
recommended for open-shell systems.
It is important to note that the quadratically-convergent algorithm is not yet fully
optimized and often converges slowly when the RMS of the cumulant or
the orbital gradient is below <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{-7}\)</span>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The choice of the iterative algorithm can significantly affect the cost of the
energy computation. While the two-step algorithm requires a small number of
disk-intensive <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\cal O}(N^5)\)</span> integral transformations, the simultaneous
algorithm benefits from a smaller number of expensive <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\cal O}(N^6)\)</span>
cumulant updates. As a result, for small closed-shell systems the two-step
algorithm is usually preferred, while for larger systems and molecules with
open-shell character it is recommended to use the simultaneous algorithm.
Efficiency of the simultaneous algorithm can be greatly increased by avoiding
the transformation of the four-index virtual two-electron integrals
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((vv|vv)\)</span> and computing the terms that involve these integrals in the AO
basis. In order to do that one needs to set the <a href="#id19"><span class="problematic" id="id20">|dct__ao_basis|</span></a> option to
DISK (currently used by default). For more recommendations on the choice of the algorithm see
<a class="reference internal" href="#sec-dctrecommend"><span class="std std-ref">Recommendations</span></a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="analytic-gradients">
<span id="sec-dctgradients"></span><h2>Analytic Gradients<a class="headerlink" href="#analytic-gradients" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Analytic gradients are available for the DC-06, ODC-06, ODC-12, and ODC-13 methods.
For DC-06, the evaluation of the analytic gradients requires the solution of the
coupled response equations. Two algorithms are available for their iterative
solution: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TWOSTEP</span></code> (default) and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SIMULTANEOUS</span></code>. These algorithms are similar to those
described for the orbital and cumulant updates in the <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-dctalgorithms"><span class="std std-ref">Iterative Algorithms</span></a>
section and usually exhibit similar efficiency. The choice of the algorithm can
be made using the <a href="#id21"><span class="problematic" id="id22">|dct__response_algorithm|</span></a> option. For the DC-12 method the
analytic gradients are not yet available, one has to use numerical gradients to
perform the geometry optimizations. For the ODC-06, ODC-12 and ODC-13 methods no response equations
need to be solved, which makes the computation of the analytic gradients very
efficient. Analytic gradients are not available for the three-particle energy
correction <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\lambda_3)\)</span>.</p>

<section id="recommendations">
<span id="sec-dctrecommend"></span><h2>Recommendations<a class="headerlink" href="#recommendations" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Here is a list of recommendations for the DCT module:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Generally, the use of the simultaneous algorithm together with the
<a href="#id29"><span class="problematic" id="id30">|dct__ao_basis|</span></a> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DISK</span></code> option is recommended (set by default).</p></li>
<li><p>In cases when available memory is insufficient, the use of the <a href="#id31"><span class="problematic" id="id32">|dct__ao_basis|</span></a> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DISK</span></code> option
is recommended. This will significantly reduce the memory requirements. However, when
used together with the two-step algorithm, this option can significantly
increase the cost of the energy computation.</p></li>
<li><p>In cases when the oscillatory convergence is observed before the DIIS
extrapolation is initialized, it is recommended to increase the threshold for
the RMS of the density cumulant or orbital update residual, below which the
DIIS extrapolation starts. This can be done by setting the
<a href="#id33"><span class="problematic" id="id34">|dct__diis_start_convergence|</span></a> option to the value greater than
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{-3}\)</span> by one or two orders of magnitude (<em>e.g.</em> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{-2}\)</span> or
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{-1}\)</span>). This can be particularly useful for computations using the
ODC methods, because it can greatly reduce the number of iterations.</p></li>
<li><p>If oscillatory convergence is observed for atoms or molecules with high
symmetry, it is recommended to use the quadratically-convergent algorithm.</p></li>
<li><p>When using the quadratically-convergent algorithm for the closed-shell molecules, it
is recommended to set the <a href="#id35"><span class="problematic" id="id36">|dct__qc_coupling|</span></a> option to FALSE for efficiency
reasons (set by default).</p></li>
<li><p>For the ODC computations, the user has a choice of performing the computation of the guess orbitals and cumulants
using the corresponding DC method (set <a href="#id37"><span class="problematic" id="id38">|dct__odc_guess|</span></a> to TRUE). This can often lead to
significant computational savings, since the orbital update step in the DC methods is cheap.
Convergence of the guess orbitals and cumulants can be controlled using the
<a href="#id39"><span class="problematic" id="id40">|dct__guess_r_convergence|</span></a> option.</p></li>
