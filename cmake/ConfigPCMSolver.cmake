# [1] It's nice to have a full PCMSolver::PCMSolver target that has embedded
# the library, the linking library paths with dependencies, and the include
# paths with dependencies, just like FindPCMSolver supplies, especially
# since src/bin/libpsipcm needs the headers for compilation and src/bin/psi4
# needs all the linking libraries. Problem is that conventional target
# derived from ExternalProject_Add is a highly sought but not quite
# certified cmake pattern. Hence INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES complains
# that the directories don't exist at configure time. Hence the hack to
# create an empty directory.
